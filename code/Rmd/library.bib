abstract = {Background Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen and ??-smooth muscle actin in the lung. The key molecules that promote these phenotypes are of clinical interest. Objectives Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been found at high levels in patients with asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and TSLP has been proposed as a primary driver of lung fibrotic disease. We asked whether tumor necrosis factor superfamily protein 14 (TNFSF14) (aka LIGHT) controls TSLP production to initiate fibrosis. Methods Expression of TSLP and initiation of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin were assessed in mice deficient in LIGHT. The ability of recombinant LIGHT, given intratracheally to naive mice, to promote TSLP and fibrosis was also determined. Results Genetic deletion of LIGHT abolished lung TSLP expression driven by bleomycin, accompanied by near-complete absence of accumulation of lung collagen and ??-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, recombinant LIGHT administered in vivo induced lung expression of TSLP in the absence of other inflammatory stimuli, and strikingly reproduced the primary features of bleomycin-driven disease in a TSLP-dependent manner. Blockade of LIGHT binding to either of its receptors, herpes virus entry mediator and lymphotoxin beta receptor, inhibited clinical symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, and correspondingly both receptors were found on human bronchial epithelial cells, a primary source of TSLP. Moreover, LIGHT induced TSLP directly in human bronchial epithelial cells and synergized with IL-13 and TGF-?? in vivo to promote TSLP in the lungs and drive fibrosis. Conclusions These results show that LIGHT is a profibrogenic cytokine that may be a key driver of TSLP production during the initiation and development of lung fibrotic disease.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {The past several years have seen the accumulation of evidence demonstrating that tissue injury induced by diverse toxicants is due not only to their direct effects on target tissues but also indirectly to the actions of resident and infiltrating macrophages. These cells release an array of mediators with cytotoxic, pro- and anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, fibrogenic, and mitogenic activity, which function to fight infections, limit tissue injury, and promote wound healing. However, following exposure to toxicants, macrophages can become hyperresponsive, resulting in uncontrolled or dysregulated release of mediators that exacerbate acute tissue injury and/or promote the development of chronic diseases such as fibrosis and cancer. Evidence suggests that the diverse activity of macrophages is mediated by distinct subpopulations that develop in response to signals within their microenvironment. Understanding the precise roles of these different macrophage populations in the pathogenic response to toxicants is key to designing effective treatments for minimizing tissue damage and chronic disease and for facilitating wound repair.},

Although microarrays have increased the rate of genomic data collection, sample size is still a major issue when identifying informative genetic biomarkers. Because of this, feature selection methods often suffer from false discoveries, resulting in poorly performing predictive models. We develop a simple meta-analysis-based feature selection method that captures the knowledge in each individual dataset and combines the results using a simple rank average. In a comprehensive study that measures robustness in terms of clinical application (i.e., breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer), microarray platform heterogeneity, and classifier (i.e., logistic regression, diagonal LDA, and linear SVM), we compare the rank average meta-analysis method to five other meta-analysis methods. Results indicate that rank average meta-analysis consistently performs well compared to five other meta-analysis methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Problems related to the safety and efficacy of gene therapies have checked the enthusiasm once surrounding this field, though it remains a promising approach for the treatment of numerous diseases. Despite the high transfection efficiencies attainable using viral vectors, manufacturing difficulties, safety concerns, and limitations related to targeting and plasmid size have prompted considerable research into the development of non-viral vectors. Non-viral vectors demonstrate low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and ease of manufacture. However, they have not yet achieved the transfection efficiencies displayed by viruses. The inability to explain or predict transfection efficiencies results, in part, from insufficient understanding of the intracellular processes involved in gene delivery. Increasingly, research has been undertaken to probe the processes involved in overcoming the major obstacles to vector-mediated transfection: (1) internalization, (2) intracellular trafficking, (3) escape to the cytosol, (4) nuclear translocation, and (5) gene transcription/expression. This paper reviews and compares the pathways and techniques involved in successful viral and non-viral transfection. In addition, this review provides evidence that non-viral vector development has been pursued successfully thus far, producing systems capable of evading almost all major obstacles to transfection. Evaluating the abilities of non-viral and viral vectors to overcome specific cellular barriers reveals that the greatest advantage of viral vectors may be related to viral DNA, which is transcribed considerably more efficiently than plasmid DNA. Further study in this area should enable the development of non-viral vectors that transfect as efficiently as viral vectors.},

abstract = {Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissue or organ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of proteases known to regulate the turn-over of ECM and so they are suggested to be important in tissue remodelling observed during fibrogenic process associated with chronic inflammation. Tissue remodelling is the result of an imbalance in the equilibrium of the normal processes of synthesis and degradation of ECM components markedly controlled by the MMPs/TIMP imbalance. We previously showed an association of the differences in collagen deposition in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with a reduced molar pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. Using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) preclinical model of liver fibrosis in mice, we observed a significant increase in collagen deposition with increased expression and release of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 both at 24 h and 3 weeks later. This suggests an early altered regulation of matrix turnover involved in the development of fibrosis. We also demonstrated an activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway associated with the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling in the development of experimental fibrosis both in lung and liver. This was also associated with an increased expression of purinergic receptors mainly P2X7 Finally, these observations emphasize those effective therapies for these disorders must be given early in the natural history of the disease, prior to the development of tissue remodelling and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Background The initiation and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. IL-33, an important cytokine for respiratory diseases, is overexpressed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Objectives We aimed to determine the effects and mechanism of IL-33 on the development and severity of pulmonary fibrosis in murine bleomycin-induced fibrosis. MethodsLung fibrosis was induced by bleomycin in wild-type or Il33r (St2)-/-C57BL/6 mice treated with the recombinant mature form of IL-33 or anti-IL-33 antibody or transferred with type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). The development and severity of fibrosis was evaluated based on lung histology, collagen levels, and lavage cytology. Cytokine and chemokine levels were quantified by using quantitative PCR, ELISA, and cytometry. Results IL-33 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells but is induced in macrophages by bleomycin. Bleomycin enhanced the production of the mature but reduced full-length form of IL-33 in lung tissue. ST2 deficiency, anti-IL-33 antibody treatment, or alveolar macrophage depletion attenuated and exogenous IL-33 or adoptive transfer of ILC2s enhanced bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. These pathologic changes were accompanied, respectively, by reduced or increased IL-33, IL-13, TGF-$\beta$1, and inflammatory chemokine production in the lung. Furthermore, IL-33 polarized M2 macrophages to produce IL-13 and TGF-$\beta$1 and induced the expansion of ILC2s to produce IL-13 in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions IL-33 is a novel profibrogenic cytokine that signals through ST2 to promote the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis by recruiting and directing inflammatory cell function and enhancing profibrogenic cytokine production in an ST2- and macrophage-dependent manner.},

This study aimed to investigate the influence of ApoE expression on lung cancer. In lung cancer tissues, ApoE expression was more frequently found in malignant pleural effusions (MPE)-associated lung adenocarcinoma than in lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma without MPE (P{\textless} 0.05), indicating that ApoE is associated with the pathogenesis of MPE in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Next, we examined the roles of ApoE in an MPE-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line that endogenously over-expresses ApoE, PC14PE6/AS2 (AS2). In that experiment we inhibited ApoE expression by transfection of a plasmid carrying ApoE siRNAs into AS2 cells to generate AS-S2 and AS-S3 cells. Compared to vector-control cells and parental AS2 cells, AS2-S2 and AS2-S3 cells grew slower (P{\textless} 0.05), were more sensitive to cisplatin, and had significantly impaired cellular migration (P{\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, over-expression of ApoE was independently associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients who had MPE at the time of diagnosis (P{\textless} 0.001). Conclusively, ApoE over-expression promotes cancer proliferation and migration and contributes to an aggressive clinical course in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and MPE. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {AIM Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by immune abnormalities, progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and microvascular injury and damage. Interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is expressed in the epidermis from patients with SSc. However, information describing the role of IL-21 in SSc is limited. METHODS We established a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) IL-21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells in peripheral blood, skin and lungs of BLM-induced mice were detected by flow cytometry; IL-21 levels in the peripheral blood were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD4(+) T cells were isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced and control mice and cultured in vitro alone or in the presence of mrIL-21 or mrIL-21 plus transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$1. The frequency of Th17 cells was detected by flow cytometry; levels of IL-17 were evaluated by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors gamma t (ROR$\gamma$t) messenger RNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Compared to control mice, the frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were significantly increased in BLM-induced mice. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were correlated with dermal and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analyses indicate that IL-21 promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells from CD4(+) cells isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced mice. CONCLUSION IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSc as a Th17 effector cytokine, and IL-21 may induce the differentiation of Th17 cells in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model.},

The potential roles of genetic alterations in DLGG development have not yet been fully delineated. Therefore, the current study performed an integrated gene expression meta-analysis of eight independent, publicly available microarray datasets including 291 DLGGs and 83 non-glioma (NG) samples to identify gene expression signatures associated with DLGG. Using INMEX, 708 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (385 upregulated and 323 downregulated genes) were identified in DLGG compared to NG. Furthermore, 497 DEGs (222 upregulated and 275 downregulated genes) corresponding to two histological types were identified. Of these, high expression of HIP1R significantly correlated with increased overall survival, whereas high expression of TBXAS1 significantly correlated with decreased overall survival. Additionally, network-based meta-analysis identified FN1 and APP as the key hub genes in DLGG compared with NG. PTPN6 and CUL3 were the key hub genes identified in the astrocytoma relative to the oligodendroglioma. Further immunohistochemical validation revealed that MTHFD2 and SPARC were positively expressed in DLGG, whereas RBP4 was positively expressed in NG. These findings reveal potential molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy in patients with DLGG and provide a rich and novel candidate reservoir for future studies.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive inflammatory disease with limited therapeutic options. To better understand the inflammatory responses that precede and concur with collagen deposition, we used three models of pulmonary fibrosis and identify a critical mechanistic role for IL-17A. After exposure to bleomycin (BLM), but not Schistosoma mansoni eggs, IL-17A produced by CD4(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells induced significant neutrophilia and pulmonary fibrosis. Studies conducted with C57BL/6 il17a(-/-) mice confirmed an essential role for IL-17A. Mechanistically, using ifngamma(-/-), il10(-/-), il10(-/-)il12p40(-/-), and il10(-/-)il17a(-/-) mice and TGF-beta blockade, we demonstrate that IL-17A-driven fibrosis is suppressed by IL-10 and facilitated by IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40. BLM-induced IL-17A production was also TGF-beta dependent, and recombinant IL-17A-mediated fibrosis required TGF-beta, suggesting cooperative roles for IL-17A and TGF-beta in the development of fibrosis. Finally, we show that fibrosis induced by IL-1beta, which mimics BLM-induced fibrosis, is also highly dependent on IL-17A. IL-17A and IL-1beta were also increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with IPF. Together, these studies identify a critical role for IL-17A in fibrosis, illustrating the potential utility of targeting IL-17A in the treatment of drug and inflammation-induced fibrosis.},

Our study examined the hypothesis that there were distinct differences in protein expression profiles that were related to the phenotype. From among the 323+/-51 protein spots that may represent the most highly expressed proteins in BALf of these patients, 24 unique spots were isolated and proteins identified. In particular, 9 spots were present in BALf of PM/DM patients only; 12 spots were exclusive of Overlap patients and 3 spots of AS patients. From among the proteins identified, a few were classified as cytoskeletal proteins, others were involved in oxidative stress and a number of proteins were associated with general metabolic activity or immunological response and inflammation. This is the first study in which evidence is provided that a number of different proteins are expressed in different subsets of PM/DM and supports our contention that the proteomic approach would be beneficial in discovering molecules which could represent possible prognostic factors of these rare pathologies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with aberrant expression of developmental pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh). As Hh signalling contributes to multiple pro-fibrotic processes, Hh inhibition may represent a therapeutic option for IPF. However, no non-invasive biomarkers are available to monitor lung Hh activity. METHODS We assessed gene and protein expression in IPF and control lung biopsies, mouse lung, fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with sonic hedgehog (SHh), and plasma in IPF patients versus controls, and cancer patients before and after treatment with vismodegib, a Hh inhibitor. RESULTS Lung tissue from IPF patients exhibited significantly greater expression of Hh-related genes versus controls. The gene most significantly upregulated in both IPF lung biopsies and fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with SHh was CXCL14, which encodes a soluble secreted chemokine whose expression is inhibited in vitro by the addition of vismodegib. CXCL14 expression was induced by SHh overexpression in mouse lung. Circulating CXCL14 protein levels were significantly higher in plasma from IPF patients than controls. In cancer patients, circulating CXCL14 levels were significantly reduced upon vismodegib treatment. CONCLUSIONS CXCL14 is a systemic biomarker that could be used to identify IPF patients with increased Hh pathway activity and monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of Hh antagonist therapy in IPF.

abstract = {Abstract Bleomycin (BLM) is a drug used to treat different types of neoplasms. BLM's most severe adverse effect is lung toxicity, which induces remodeling of lung architecture and loss of pulmonary function, rapidly leading to death. While its clinical role as an anticancer agent is limited, its use in experimental settings is widespread since BLM is one of the most widely used drugs for inducing lung fibrosis in animals, due to its ability to provoke a histologic lung pattern similar to that described in patients undergoing chemotherapy. This pattern is characterized by patchy parenchymal inflammation, epithelial cell injury with reactive hyperplasia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, activation and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, basement membrane and alveolar epithelium injuries. Several studies have demonstrated that BLM damage is mediated by DNA strand scission producing single- or double-strand breaks that lead to increased production of free radicals. Up to now, the mechanisms involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis have not been fully understood; several studies have analyzed various potential biological molecular factors, such as transforming growth factor beta 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, components of the extracellular matrix, chaperones, interleukins and chemokines. The aim of this paper is to review the specific characteristics of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in different animal models and to summarize modalities and timing of in vivo drug administration. Understanding the mechanisms of BLM-induced lung fibrosis and of commonly used therapies for counteracting fibrosis provides an opportunity for translating potential molecular targets from animal models to the clinical arena.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

Exosomes, membrane vesicles released from cells within the lung allograft, contain a diverse array of biomolecules that closely reflect the biologic state of the cell and tissue from which they are released.

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

For fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix to occur, there must be a geometric increase in neovascularization. We hypothesized that net angiogenesis during the pathogenesis of fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis are dependent in part upon an overexpression of the angiogenic CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). To test this hypothesis, we measured MIP-2 by specific ELISA in whole lung homogenates in either bleomycin-treated or control CBA/J mice and correlated these levels with lung hydroxyproline. We found that lung tissue from mice treated with bleomycin, compared with that from saline-treated controls, demonstrated a significant increase in the presence of MIP-2 that was correlated to a greater angiogenic response and total lung hydroxyproline content. Neutralizing anti-MIP-2 Abs inhibited the angiogenic activity of day 16 bleomycin-treated lung specimens using an in vivo angiogenesis bioassay. Furthermore, when MIP-2 was depleted in vivo by passive immunization, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced without a change in the presence of pulmonary neutrophils, fibroblast proliferation, or collagen gene expression. This was also paralleled by a reduction in angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that the angiogenic CXC chemokine, MIP-2, is an important factor that regulates angiogenesis/fibrosis in pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Abstract Bleomycin (BLM) is a drug used to treat different types of neoplasms. BLM's most severe adverse effect is lung toxicity, which induces remodeling of lung architecture and loss of pulmonary function, rapidly leading to death. While its clinical role as an anticancer agent is limited, its use in experimental settings is widespread since BLM is one of the most widely used drugs for inducing lung fibrosis in animals, due to its ability to provoke a histologic lung pattern similar to that described in patients undergoing chemotherapy. This pattern is characterized by patchy parenchymal inflammation, epithelial cell injury with reactive hyperplasia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, activation and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, basement membrane and alveolar epithelium injuries. Several studies have demonstrated that BLM damage is mediated by DNA strand scission producing single- or double-strand breaks that lead to increased production of free radicals. Up to now, the mechanisms involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis have not been fully understood; several studies have analyzed various potential biological molecular factors, such as transforming growth factor beta 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, components of the extracellular matrix, chaperones, interleukins and chemokines. The aim of this paper is to review the specific characteristics of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in different animal models and to summarize modalities and timing of in vivo drug administration. Understanding the mechanisms of BLM-induced lung fibrosis and of commonly used therapies for counteracting fibrosis provides an opportunity for translating potential molecular targets from animal models to the clinical arena.},

abstract = {Human monocytes are commonly defined and discriminated by the extent of their cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, with associated differences in function and phenotype related to the intensity of expression of these markers. With increasing interest into the function and behaviour of monocytes, it is important to have a clear understanding of how differing strategies of analysis can affect results and how different protocols and population backgrounds can affect this highly morphogenic cell type.Using PBMCs from populations with differing ethnicities and histories of parasite exposure we have characterized monocyte phenotype based on intensity of CD14 and CD16 expression. Using the surface markers HLA-DR, CCR2 and CX3CR1, we compared monocyte phenotype between populations and further assessed changes in monocytes with freezing and thawing of PBMCs.Our results reveal that there is a progression of surface marker expression based on intensity of CD14 or CD16 expression, stressing the importance of careful gating of monocyte subtypes. Freezing and thawing of the PBMCs has no effect generally on the monocytes, although it does lead to a decrease in CD16 and CX3CR1 expression. We show that there are differences in the monocyte populations based on ethnicity and history of exposure to the common parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.This study highlights that blood monocytes consist of a continuous population of cells, within which the dominant phenotype may vary dependent on the background of the study population. Comparing results from monocyte studies therefore needs to be done with great care, as ethnic background of donor population, gating strategy and processing of PBMCs may all have an effect on outcome of monocyte phenotype. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Several studies have implicated fatty-acids as inflammatory regulators, suggesting that there may be a direct role for common dietary fatty-acids in regulating innate immune cells. In humans, a single high-fat meal increases systemic cytokines and leukocytes. In mice, short term high-fat feeding increases adipose tissue (AT) leukocytes and alters the inflammatory profile of AT macrophages. We have seen that short term high fat feeding to C57BL/6J male mice increases palmitic and oleic acid within AT depots, but oleic acid increase is highest in the mesenteric AT (MAT). In vitro, oleic acid increases M2 macrophage markers (CD206, MGL1, and ARG1) in a murine macrophage cell line, while addition of palmitic acid is able to inhibit that increase. Three day supplementation of a chow diet, with oleic acid, induced an increase in M2 macrophage markers in the MAT, but not in the epididymal AT. We tested whether increases in M2 macrophages occur during short term ad lib feeding of a high fat diet, containing oleic acid. Experiments revealed two distinct populations of macrophages were altered by a three day high milk-fat diet. One population, phenotypically intermediate for F4/80, showed diet-induced increases in CD206, an anti-inflammatory marker characteristic of M2 macrophages intrinsic to the AT. Evidence for a second population, phenotypically F4/80(HI)CD11b(HI) macrophages, showed increased association with the MAT following short term feeding that is dependent on the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1. Collectively, we have shown that short term feeding of a high-fat diet changes two population of macrophages, and that dietary oleic acid is responsible for increases in M2 macrophage polarization.},

abstract = {The lack of a method for demonstrating the presence of Treponema pallidum by growth necessitates the use of alternative methods. Traditionally, these methods are divided into direct detection methods (animal inoculation, dark-field microscopy, etc.) and serologic tests for the presence of patient antibody against T. pallidum. Serologic methods are further divided into two classes. One class, the nontreponemal tests, detects antibodies to lipoidal antigens present in either the host or T. pallidum; examples are the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma reagin and tests. Reactivity in these tests generally indicates host tissue damage that may not be specific for syphilis. Because these tests are easy and inexpensive to perform, they are commonly used for screening, and with proper clinical signs they are suggestive of syphilis. The other class of test, the treponemal tests, uses specific treponemal antigens. Confirmation of infection requires a reactive treponemal test. Examples of the treponemal tests are the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. These tests are more expensive and complicated to perform than the nontreponemal tests. On the horizon are a number of direct antigen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PCR techniques. Several of these techniques have shown promise in clinical trials for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis that are presently difficult to diagnose.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of syphilis can be complicated when it is based on diverse clinical manifestations, dark-field microscopy, and serology. In the present study, therefore, we examined the additional clinical value of a Treponema pallidum real-time TaqMan PCR for the detection of primary and secondary syphilis. The additional value of the T. pallidum real-time PCR for the diagnosis of primary syphilis was evaluated by the use of three different algorithms: (i) a head-to-head comparison of the dark-field microscopy result and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result, (ii) comparison of the clinical diagnosis made in a sexually transmitted infection clinic (STI) (including by dark-field microscopy) and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result, and (iii) comparison of the clinical diagnosis made in a general practitioner's office (without dark-field microscopy) and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result. A fourth algorithm was used to determine the performance of the T. pallidum real-time PCR regarding the detection of secondary syphilis. From December 2006 to April 2008, 716 patients with suspected cases of primary syphilis and 133 patients with suspected cases of secondary syphilis were included in the study. A kappa value of 0.601 was found for the agreement between dark-field microscopy and the T. pallidum real-time PCR. Good agreement was found between the T. pallidum real-time PCR and both the diagnosis of the general practitioner (kappa = 0.745) and the diagnosis of the STI clinic (kappa = 0.769). The sensitivity with respect to the STI clinic diagnosis was 72.8{\%}, the specificity was 95.5{\%}, the positive predictive value was 89.2{\%}, and the negative predictive value was 95.0{\%}. The T. pallidum real-time PCR is a fast, efficient, and reliable test for the diagnosis of primary syphilis in an STI outpatient clinic and a general practitioner setting, but it has no added diagnostic value for the diagnosis of secondary syphilis.},

abstract = {Data from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses. Effects on normalization: Most normalization methods enable successful clustering of samples according to biological origin when the groups differ substantially in their overall microbial composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters samples according to biological origin than other normalization techniques do for ordination metrics based on presence or absence. Alternate normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to artifacts due to library size. Effects on differential abundance testing: We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of many differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available data. For groups with large ({\~{}}10×) differences in the average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate. DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on smaller datasets ({\textless}20 samples per group) but tends towards a higher false discovery rate with more samples, very uneven ({\~{}}10×) library sizes, and/or compositional effects. For drawing inferences regarding taxon abundance in the ecosystem, analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) is not only very sensitive (for {\textgreater}20 samples per group) but also critically the only method tested that has a good control of false discovery rate. These findings guide which normalization and differential abundance techniques to use based on the data characteristics of a given study.},

abstract = {Classically (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions. It has been difficult to dissect macrophage phenotypes in vivo, where a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes exists, and also in vitro, where low or non-selective M2 marker protein expression is observed. To provide a foundation for the complexity of in vivo macrophage phenotypes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional signature of murine M0, M1 and M2 macrophages and identified genes common or exclusive to either subset. We validated by real-time PCR an M1-exclusive pattern of expression for CD38, G-protein coupled receptor 18 (Gpr18) and Formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) whereas Early growth response protein 2 (Egr2) and c-Myc were M2-exclusive. We further confirmed these data by flow cytometry and show that M1 and M2 macrophages can be distinguished by their relative expression of CD38 and Egr2. Egr2 labeled more M2 macrophages ({\~{}}70{\%}) than the canonical M2 macrophage marker Arginase-1, which labels 24{\%} of M2 macrophages. Conversely, CD38 labeled most (71{\%}) in vitro M1 macrophages. In vivo, a similar CD38+ population greatly increased after LPS exposure. Overall, this work defines exclusive and common M1 and M2 signatures and provides novel and improved tools to distinguish M1 and M2 murine macrophages.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The assessment of data quality is a major concern in microarray analysis. arrayQualityMetrics is a Bioconductor package that provides a report with diagnostic plots for one or two colour microarray data. The quality metrics assess reproducibility, identify apparent outlier arrays and compute measures of signal-to-noise ratio. The tool handles most current microarray technologies and is amenable to use in automated analysis pipelines or for automatic report generation, as well as for use by individuals. The diagnosis of quality remains, in principle, a context-dependent judgement, but our tool provides powerful, automated, objective and comprehensive instruments on which to base a decision. AVAILABILITY arrayQualityMetrics is a free and open source package, under LGPL license, available from the Bioconductor project at www.bioconductor.org. A users guide and examples are provided with the package. Some examples of HTML reports generated by arrayQualityMetrics can be found at http://www.microarray-quality.org},

abstract = {Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in type 2 immunity. Mice deficient in ST2, a receptor for the latest member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, have impaired type 2 immune responses. We therefore reasoned that IL-33/ST2 signaling may be involved in the differentiation and activation of AAM during airway inflammation. We report here that IL-33 changed the quiescent phenotype of alveolar macrophages toward an AAM phenotype that expressed mannose receptor, IL-4Ralpha, and produced high levels of CCL24 and CCL17 in an IL-13-dependent manner during IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Neutralization of AAM-derived CCL24 led to an amelioration of IL-33-induced eosinophilia in the lungs. Moreover, depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Additionally, the attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation in ST2(-/-) mice was associated with a decrease in AAM differentiation. In vitro, IL-33 amplified IL-13-induced polarization of alveolar- and bone marrow-derived macrophage toward an AAM phenotype by increasing the expression of arginase I, Ym1, as well as the production of CCL24 and CCL17. IL-13/IL-4Ralpha signaling was crucial for IL-33-driven AAM amplification by inducing the expression of ST2L. Finally, we showed that IL-33 was more abundantly expressed in the lung epithelial cells of asthma patients than those from healthy controls, suggesting that IL-33 may be involved in lung macrophage activation in clinical asthma. Taken together, we demonstrate here that IL-33/ST2 plays a significant role in the amplification of AAM polarization and chemokine production which contribute to innate and Ag-induced airway inflammation.},

The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets. The strength and efficacy of the host response is shaped by the tissue microenvironment. In preclinical models of disease, host immune augmentation strategies have yielded benefits, yet translating these insights into therapeutic strategies in humans remains challenging. SUMMARY Although advances in early diagnostic strategies and in antifungal drugs have ameliorated clinical outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, further improvements depend on gaining deeper insight into and translating advances in anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

Whether dysfunctional telomeres contribute directly to development of lung fibrosis remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate whether telomere dysfunction in type II AECs, mediated by deletion of the telomere shelterin protein TRF1, leads to pulmonary fibrosis in mice (SPC-Cre TRF1fl/fl mice). Deletion of TRF1 in type II AECs for 2 weeks increased {\$}\backslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}H2AX DNA damage foci, but not histopathologic changes in the lung. Deletion of TRF1 in type II AECs for up to 9 months resulted in short telomeres and lung remodeling characterized by increased numbers of type II AECs, {\$}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-smooth muscle actin+ mesenchymal cells, collagen deposition, and accumulation of senescence-associated {\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-galactosidase+ lung epithelial cells. Deletion of TRF1 in collagen-expressing cells caused pulmonary edema, but not fibrosis. These results demonstrate that prolonged telomere dysfunction in type II AECs, but not collagen-expressing cells, leads to age-dependent lung remodeling and fibrosis. We conclude that telomere dysfunction in type II AECs is sufficient to cause lung fibrosis, and may be a dominant molecular defect causing IPF. SPC-Cre TRF1fl/fl mice will be useful for assessing cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung fibrosis mediated by telomere dysfunction.},

abstract = {Findings from clinical and biological studies are often not reproducible when tested in independent cohorts. Due to the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, results from whole-genome expression studies in particular are often not reproducible. Compared to single-study analysis, gene expression meta-analysis can improve reproducibility by integrating data from multiple studies. However, there are multiple choices in designing and carrying out a meta-analysis. Yet, clear guidelines on best practices are scarce. Here, we hypothesized that studying subsets of very large meta-analyses would allow for systematic identification of best practices to improve reproducibility. We therefore constructed three very large gene expression meta-analyses from clinical samples, and then examined meta-analyses of subsets of the datasets (all combinations of datasets with up to N/2 samples and K/2 datasets) compared to a 'silver standard' of differentially expressed genes found in the entire cohort. We tested three random-effects meta-analysis models using this procedure. We showed relatively greater reproducibility with more-stringent effect size thresholds with relaxed significance thresholds; relatively lower reproducibility when imposing extraneous constraints on residual heterogeneity; and an underestimation of actual false positive rate by Benjamini-Hochberg correction. In addition, multivariate regression showed that the accuracy of a meta-analysis increased significantly with more included datasets even when controlling for sample size.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

At steady state most of macrophages are derived from fetal sources and maintained in adulthood through self-renewing. Despite sharing common progenitors, a remarkable heterogeneity characterized tissue-resident macrophages indicating that local signals educate them to express organ-specific functions. Macrophages are extremely plastic: chromatin landscape and transcriptional programs can be dynamically re-shaped in response to microenvironmental changes. Owing to their ductility, macrophages are crucial orchestrators of both initiation and resolution of immune responses and key supporters of tissue development and functions in homeostatic and pathological conditions. Herein, we describe current understanding of heterogeneity and plasticity of macrophages using the M1-M2 dichotomy as operationally useful simplification of polarized activation. We focused on the complex network of signaling cascades, metabolic pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic changes that control macrophage activation. In particular, this network was addressed in sepsis, as a paradigm of a pathological condition determining dynamic macrophage reprogramming.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which macrophages control the inflammatory response, wound healing, biomaterial-interactions, and tissue regeneration appear to be related to their activation/differentiation states. Studies of macrophage behavior in vitro can be useful for elucidating their mechanisms of action, but it is not clear to what extent the source of macrophages affects their apparent behavior, potentially affecting interpretation of results. Although comparative studies of macrophage behavior with respect to cell source have been conducted, there has been no direct comparison of the three most commonly used cell sources: murine bone marrow, human monocytes from peripheral blood (PB), and the human leukemic monocytic cell line THP-1, across multiple macrophage phenotypes. In this study, we used multivariate discriminant analysis to compare the in vitro expression of genes commonly chosen to assess macrophage phenotype across all three sources of macrophages, as well as those derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), that were polarized towards four distinct phenotypes using the same differentiation protocols: M(LPS,IFN) (aka M1), M(IL4,IL13) (aka M2a), M(IL10) (aka M2c), and M(-) (aka M0) used as control. Several differences in gene expression trends were found among the sources of macrophages, especially between murine bone marrow-derived and human blood-derived M(LPS,IFN) and M(IL4,IL13) macrophages with respect to commonly used phenotype markers like CCR7 and genes associated with angiogenesis and tissue regeneration like FGF2 and MMP9. We found that the genes with the most similar patterns of expression among all sources were CXCL-10 and CXCL-11 for M(LPS,IFN) and CCL17 and CCL22 for M(IL4,IL13). Human PB-derived macrophages and human iPSC-derived macrophages showed similar gene expression patterns among the groups and genes studied here, suggesting that iPSC-derived monocytes have the potential to be used as a reliable cell source of human macrophages for in vitro studies. These findings could help select appropriate markers when testing macrophage behavior in vitro and highlight those markers that may confuse interpretation of results from experiments employing macrophages from different sources.},

abstract = {he origins of the mesenchymal cells participating in tissue repair and pathological processes, notably tissue fibrosis, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis, are poorly understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) represent one important source of these cells. As we discuss here, processes similar to the EMTs associated with embryo implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development are appropriated and subverted by chronically inflamed tissues and neoplasias. The identification of the signaling pathways that lead to activation of EMT programs during these disease processes is providing new insights into the plasticity of cellular phenotypes and possible therapeutic interventions},

Moreover, CCL3 protein was detected mainly in infiltrating granulocytes and macrophages, whereas transforming growth factor-{\$}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}1 protein was detected in macrophages and myofibroblasts.

Moreover, the BLM-induced increases in intrapulmonary macrophage and fibrocyte numbers were attenuated in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice, although BLM increased bone marrow (BM) fibrocyte number to a similar extent in these strains. BM transplantation from CCR5-/-to WT, but not that from WT to CCR5-/-mice, recapitulated the phenotypes in CCR5-/-mice. Furthermore, CCR5+/-mice exhibited a significant reduction in BLM-induced fibrotic changes.

abstract = {Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a key component of high-density lipoproteins that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from cells and reduces vascular inflammation. We investigated whether endogenous apoA-I modulates ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation in mice. We found that apoA-I expression was significantly reduced in the lungs of OVA-challenged, compared with saline-challenged, wild-type (WT) mice. Next, to investigate the role of endogenous apoA-I in the pathogenesis of OVA-induced airway inflammation, WT and apoA-I(-/-) mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of OVA and aluminum hydroxide, followed by multiple nasal OVA challenges for 4 weeks. OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice exhibited a phenotype of increased airway neutrophils compared with WT mice, which could be rescued by an administration of a 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Multiple pathways promoted neutrophilic inflammation in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, including the up-regulated expression of (1) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A and TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$}), (2) CXC chemokines (CXCL5), (3) vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and (4) granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). Because concentrations of G-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly increased in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, we hypothesized that enhanced G-CSF expression may represent the predominant pathway mediating increased neutrophilic inflammation. This was confirmed by the intranasal administration of a neutralizing anti-G-CSF antibody, which significantly reduced BALF neutrophilia by 72{\%} in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, compared with mice that received a control antibody. We conclude that endogenous apoA-I negatively regulates OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, primarily via a G-CSF-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, these findings suggest that apoA-I may play an important role in modulating the severity of neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.},

abstract = {Peripheral blood monocytes are a population of circulating mononuclear phagocytes that harbor potential to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. As in humans, monocytes in the mouse comprise two phenotypically distinct subsets that are Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) and Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high), respectively. The question remains whether these populations contribute differentially to the generation of peripheral mononuclear phagocytes. In this study, we track the fate of adoptively transferred, fractionated monocyte subsets in the lung of recipient mice. We show that under inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions, both monocyte subsets give rise to pulmonary dendritic cells. In contrast, under the conditions studied, only Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high) monocytes, but not Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) cells, had the potential to differentiate into lung macrophages. However, Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) monocytes could acquire this potential upon conversion into Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high) cells. Our results therefore indicate an intrinsic dichotomy in the differentiation potential of the two main blood monocyte subsets.},

abstract = {Clear identification of specific cell populations by flow cytometry is important to understand functional roles. A well-defined flow cytometry panel for myeloid cells in human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a flow cytometry-based panel for human BAL and lung tissue. We obtained and performed flow cytometry/sorting on human BAL cells and lung tissue. Confocal images were obtained from lung tissue using antibodies for cluster of differentiation (CD)206, CD169, and E cadherin. We defined a multicolor flow panel for human BAL and lung tissue that identifies major leukocyte populations. These include macrophage (CD206(+)) subsets and other CD206(-) leukocytes. The CD206(-) cells include: (1) three monocyte (CD14(+)) subsets, (2) CD11c(+) dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(+), HLA-DR(+)), (3) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(+)), and (4) other granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils). Using this panel on human lung tissue, we defined two populations of pulmonary macrophages: CD169(+) and CD169(-) macrophages. In lung tissue, CD169(-) macrophages were a prominent cell type. Using confocal microscopy, CD169(+) macrophages were located in the alveolar space/airway, defining them as alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CD169(-) macrophages were associated with airway/alveolar epithelium, consistent with interstitial-associated macrophages. We defined a flow cytometry panel in human BAL and lung tissue that allows identification of multiple immune cell types and delineates alveolar from interstitial-associated macrophages. This study has important implications for defining myeloid cells in human lung samples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes in time course RNA-Seq data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of transcriptional regulatory network. However, most of the available methods treat gene expressions at different time points as replicates and test the significance of the mean expression difference between treatments or conditions irrespective of time. They thus fail to identify many DE genes with different profiles across time. In this article, we propose a negative binomial mixed-effect model (NBMM) to identify DE genes in time course RNA-Seq data. In the NBMM, mean gene expression is characterized by a fixed effect, and time dependency is described by random effects. The NBMM is very flexible and can be fitted to both unreplicated and replicated time course RNA-Seq data via a penalized likelihood method. By comparing gene expression profiles over time, we further classify the DE genes into two subtypes to enhance the understanding of expression dynamics. A significance test for detecting DE genes is derived using a Kullback-Leibler distance ratio. Additionally, a significance test for gene sets is developed using a gene set score. RESULTS Simulation analysis shows that the NBMM outperforms currently available methods for detecting DE genes and gene sets. Moreover, our real data analysis of fruit fly developmental time course RNA-Seq data demonstrates the NBMM identifies biologically relevant genes which are well justified by gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method is powerful and efficient to detect biologically relevant DE genes and gene sets in time course RNA-Seq data.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal, chronic, progressive disease characterized by formation of scar tissue within the lungs. Because it is a disease of unknown etiology, it is difficult to diagnose, to predict disease course and to devise treatment strategies. Recent evidence suggests that activated macrophages play key roles in the pathology of IPF. Therefore, imaging probes that specifically recognize these pools of activated immune cells could provide valuable information about how these cells contribute to the pathobiology of the disease. Here we demonstrate that cysteine cathepsin-targeted imaging probes can be used to monitor the contribution of macrophages to fibrotic disease progression in the bleomycin-induced murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we show that the probes highlight regions of macrophage involvement in fibrosis in human biopsy tissues from IPF patients. Finally, we present first-in-human results demonstrating non-invasive imaging of active cathepsins in fibrotic lesions of patients with IPF. Together, our findings validate small molecule cysteine cathepsin probes for clinical PET imaging and suggest that they have the potential to be used to generate mechanistically-informative molecular information regarding cellular drivers of IPF disease severity and progression.},

Common methods currently used to estimate the response of innate immune cells to stimuli are usually biased toward a single mode of activation. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of designing an assay based on unbiased proteome analysis that would be capable of predicting the complex response of the innate immune system to various challenges. Monocytes were used as representative cells of the innate immune system. The underlying hypothesis was that their proteome response to different activating molecules would reflect the immunogenicity of these molecules. To identify the main modes of response, we treated the human monocytic THP-1 cell line with nine different stimuli. Differentiation and activation were determined to be the two major modes of monocyte response, with PMA causing the strongest differentiation and Pam3CSK4 causing the strongest proinflammatory activation. The established assay was applied to characterize the monocyte response to epidermal growth factor peptide containing isoaspartate, which induced differentiation but not proinflammatory activation. Because of its versatility, robustness, and specificity, this new assay is likely to find a niche among the more established immunological methods. {\textcopyright}2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Understanding the functional implications of changes in gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

To extract maximum value from the accumulating mass of publicly available cancer gene expression data, methods are needed to evaluate, integrate, and intervalidate multiple datasets. Here we demonstrate a statistical model for performing meta-analysis of independent microarray datasets. Implementation of this model revealed that four prostate cancer gene expression datasets shared significantly similar results, independent of the method and technology used (i.e., spotted cDNA versus oligonucleotide). This interstudy cross-validation approach generated a cohort of genes that were consistently and significantly dysregulated in prostate cancer. Bioinformatic investigation of these genes revealed a synchronous network of transcriptional regulation in the polyamine and purine biosynthesis pathways. Beyond the specific implications for prostate cancer, this work establishes a much-needed model for the evaluation, cross-validation, and comparison of multiple cancer profiling studies.},

abstract = {We describe a novel approach named REAL-Select for the non-covalent display of IgG-molecules on the surface of yeast cells for the purpose of antibody engineering and selection. It relies on the capture of secreted native full-length antibodies on the cell surface via binding to an externally immobilized ZZ domain, which tightly binds antibody Fc. It is beneficial for high-throughput screening of yeast-displayed IgG-libraries during antibody discovery and development. In a model experiment, antibody-displaying yeast cells were isolated from a 1:1,000,000 mixture with control cells confirming the maintenance of genotype-phenotype linkage. Antibodies with improved binding characteristics were obtained by affinity maturation using REAL-Select, demonstrating the ability of this system to display antibodies in their native form and to detect subtle changes in affinity by flow cytometry. The biotinylation of the cell surface followed by functionalization with a streptavidin-ZZ fusion protein is an approach that is independent of the genetic background of the antibody-producing host and therefore can be expected to be compatible with other eukaryotic expression hosts such as P. pastoris or mammalian cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As high-throughput genomic technologies become accurate and affordable, an increasing number of data sets have been accumulated in the public domain and genomic information integration and meta-analysis have become routine in biomedical research. In this paper, we focus on microarray meta-analysis, where multiple microarray studies with relevant biological hypotheses are combined in order to improve candidate marker detection. Many methods have been developed and applied in the literature, but their performance and properties have only been minimally investigated. There is currently no clear conclusion or guideline as to the proper choice of a meta-analysis method given an application; the decision essentially requires both statistical and biological considerations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed 12 microarray meta-analysis methods for combining multiple simulated expression profiles, and such methods can be categorized for different hypothesis setting purposes: (1) HSA: DE genes with non-zero effect sizes in all studies, (2) HSB: DE genes with non-zero effect sizes in one or more studies and (3) HSr: DE gene with non-zero effect in "majority" of studies. We then performed a comprehensive comparative analysis through six large-scale real applications using four quantitative statistical evaluation criteria: detection capability, biological association, stability and robustness. We elucidated hypothesis settings behind the methods and further apply multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and an entropy measure to characterize the meta-analysis methods and data structure, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The aggregated results from the simulation study categorized the 12 methods into three hypothesis settings (HSA, HSB, and HSr). Evaluation in real data and results from MDS and entropy analyses provided an insightful and practical guideline to the choice of the most suitable method in a given application. All source files for simulation and real data are available on the author's publication website.},

Whereas both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to interperson variation, their relative contributions and potential predictive power have remained largely unknown. By systematically correlating host factors in 534 healthy volunteers, including baseline immunological parameters and molecular profiles (genome, metabolome and gut microbiome), with cytokine production after stimulation with 20 pathogens, we identified distinct patterns of co-regulation. Among the 91 different cytokine–stimulus pairs, 11 categories of host factors together explained up to 67{\%} of interindividual variation in cytokine production induced by stimulation. A computational model based on genetic data predicted the genetic component of stimulus-induced cytokine production (correlation 0.28–0.89), and nongenetic factors influenced cytokine production as well.},

abstract = {Alternative activation of alveolar macrophages is linked to fibrosis following exposure to asbestos. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic M2 phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 ({\textgreater}3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-$\beta$1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Arg(432) and Arg(434) in domain V of MARCO are required for the polarization of macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype as mutation of these residues reduced FIZZ1 expression (17-fold) compared with cells expressing MARCO. These observations demonstrate that a macrophage membrane protein regulates the fibrotic response to lung injury and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention.-Murthy, S., Larson-Casey, J.

abstract = {Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, multi-systemic, autoimmune disease for which the underlying aetiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The genetic and molecular processes underlying lupus have been extensively investigated using a variety of -omics approaches, including genome-wide association studies, candidate gene studies and microarray experiments of differential gene expression in lupus samples compared to controls. This study analyses a combination of existing microarray data sets to identify differentially regulated genetic pathways that are dysregulated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients compared to unaffected controls. Two statistical approaches, quantile discretisation and scaling, are used to combine publicly available expression microarray datasets and perform a meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes implicated in interferon signaling were identified by the meta-analysis, in agreement with the findings of the individual studies that generated the datasets used. In contrast to the individual studies, however, the meta-analysis and subsequent pathway analysis additionally highlighted TLR signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and diapedesis and adhesion regulatory networks as being differentially regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients compared to controls. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to derive additional information from publicly available expression data using meta-analysis techniques, which is particularly relevant to research into rare diseases where sample numbers can be limiting.},

To date we have limited information as to predictors of mortality in patients with IPF, and research in this area has failed to yield prediction models that can be reliably used in clinical practice to predict individual risk of mortality.

IL-1ra had little or no influence on the number of cells recovered from the broncho-alveolar lavage.

abstract = {A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has an unpredictable course and prognostic factors are incompletely understood. We aimed to identify prognostic factors, including multidimensional indices from a significant IPF cohort at the Bristol Interstitial Lung Disease Centre in the UK. Patients diagnosed with IPF between 2007 and 2014 were identified. Longitudinal pulmonary physiology and exercise testing results were collated, with all-cause mortality used as the primary outcome. Factors influencing overall, 12- and 24-month survival were identified using Cox proportional hazards modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We found in this real-world cohort of 167 patients, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and initiation of long-term oxygen were independent markers of poor prognosis. Exercise testing results predicted 12-month mortality as well as DLCO, but did not perform as well for overall survival. The Composite Physiological Index was the best performing multidimensional index, but did not outperform DLCO. Our data confirmed that patients who experienced a fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) {\textgreater}10{\%} had significantly worse survival after that point (p=0.024). Our data from longitudinal follow-up in IPF show that DLCO is the best individual prognostic marker, outperforming FVC. Exercise testing is important in predicting early poor outcome.

A subset of patients develops significant pulmonary fibrosis, identified either on biopsy or radiologically. The term chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis (CFPA) has been suggested.Methods: We describe 11 patients with CFPA referred to our centre.Results: Mean age was 58.5 years and five were male. In nine, fibrosis was already evident on presentation, while in two it developed 3 and 6 years later. The predominant radiological feature was extensive or complete involvement of the entire lung, with minimal contralateral involvement. All patients received prolonged antifungal treatment. Two patients had surgical treatment; both developed post-operative complications. The contralateral lung remained free of significant disease in all but three patients.Conclusions: CFPA is a rare complication of CPA that is usually evident on presentation, but may develop after years in patients not on antifungals.

Monocytes are highly plastic and heterogeneous, and change their functional phenotype in response to environmental stimulation. Evidence from murine and human studies has suggested that monocytosis can be an indicator of various inflammatory diseases. Monocytes can differentiate into inflammatory or anti-inflammatory subsets. Upon tissue damage or infection, monocytes are rapidly recruited to the tissue, where they can differentiate into tissue macrophages or dendritic cells. Given the rapid progress in monocyte research from broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases, there is a need to summarize our knowledge in monocyte heterogeneity and its impact in human disease. In this review, we describe the current understanding of heterogeneity of human and murine monocytes, the function of distinct subsets of monocytes, and a potential mechanism for monocyte differentiation. We emphasize that inflammatory monocyte subsets are valuable biomarkers for inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular diseases.},

The balance between Th1, Th17, and FoxP3 + CD4 + T cell subsets in sarcoidosis remains unclear. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells, from 30 patients with sarcoidosis, 18 patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, and 15 healthy controls, were investigated with flow cytometry for intracellular expression of FoxP3. In a subset of the patients, expression of the cytokines IL17A and IFN- ? was investigated. The fractions of FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells and Th17 cells were both lower in sarcoidosis compared to controls ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.011 , resp.). The proportion of Th17 cells positive for IFN- ? was greater in sarcoidosis than controls (median 72.4{\%} versus 31{\%}, P = 0.0005 ) and increased with radiologic stage ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.45 , and P = 0.03 ). IFN- ? + Th17 cells were highly correlated with Th1 cells ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.64 , and P = 0.001 ), and the ratio of IFN- ? + Th17/FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells was prominently increased in sarcoidosis. IFN- ? + Th17 cells may represent a pathogenic subset of Th17 cells, yet their expression of IFN- ? could be a consequence of a Th1-polarized cytokine milieu. Our results indicate a possible immune cell imbalance in sarcoidosis.},

abstract = {Motivation RNA-seq has emerged as a powerful technology for the detection of differential gene expression in the transcriptome. The commonly used statistical methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis were designed for individual genes, which may detect too many irrelevant significantly genes or too few genes to interpret the phenotypic changes. Recently network module-based methods have been proposed as a powerful approach to analyze and interpret expression data in microarray and shotgun proteomics. But the module-based statistical model has not been adequately addressed for RNA-seq data. Result we proposed a network module-based generalized linear model for differential expression analysis of the count-based sequencing data from RNA-seq. The simulation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model and the improvement of the statistical power for identifying the differentially expressed modules in comparison to the existing methods. We also applied our method to tissue datasets and identified 207 significantly differentially expressed kidney-active or liver-active modules. For liver cancer datasets, significantly differentially expressed modules, including Wnt signaling pathway and VEGF pathway, were found to be tightly associated with liver cancer. Besides, in comparison with the single gene-level analysis, our method could identify more significantly biological modules, which related to the liver cancer.

Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania, revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. The CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are chronic inflammatory disorders leading to pulmonary fibrosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) promotes collagen synthesis and deletion of the MCP-1 receptor CCR2 protects from pulmonary fibrosis in ILD mouse models. We hypothesized that pulmonary MCP-1 and CCR2+ T cells accumulate in pediatric ILD and are related to disease severity. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained from 25 children with ILD and 10 healthy children. Levels of pulmonary MCP-1 and Th1/Th2-associated cytokines were quantified at the protein and the mRNA levels. Pulmonary CCR2+, CCR4+, CCR3+, CCR5+ and CXCR3+ T cells were quantified by flow-cytometry. RESULTS: CCR2+ T cells and MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated in children with ILD and correlated with forced vital capacity, total lung capacity and ILD disease severity scores. Children with lung fibrosis had significantly higher MCP-1 levels and CCR2+ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared to non-fibrotic children. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that pulmonary CCR2+ T cells and MCP-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of pediatric ILD and might provide a novel target for therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Bleomycin induces a transient lung fibrosis in mice that has been used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our aim was to determine a sensitive method for assessing lung function in bleomycin treated mice that correlated with the degree of lung fibrosis as measured by collagen immunohistochemistry. Bleomycin (2 U/kg) or saline was intratracheally microsprayed to male C57BL/6 mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Lung function (single compartment model, constant phase model, and work of breathing) was assessed using the flexiVent system, and after euthanasia lungs were inflated with formalin in situ for histological analysis. The lung fibrosis histopathology score for the bleomycin treated animals on day 21 was indicative of mild-to-moderate fibrosis (Saline treated control: 0 ± 0, Bleomycin treated: 4.9 ± 0.4). There were at least three large areas of fibrosis in the peribronchial alveolar regions of the lung, but less than 50{\%} of each lung was affected by fibrosis. Although changes in lung function were less obvious, volume normalized dynamic work of breathing measured at 30 ml/kg tidal volume (Saline treated control: 9.2 ± 0.1 J/l, Bleomycin treated: 10.6 ± 0.3 J/l) and the oscillatory mechanics constant phase model parameter tissue elastance (H; Saline treated control: 31 ± 2 cm H2O/ml, Bleomycin treated: 38 ± 3 cm H2O/ml) were significantly increased on day 21. The work of breathing (r = 0.83) correlated slightly better with fibrosis histopathology score than H (r = 0.64). Work of breathing can detect decrements in lung function due to pulmonary fibrosis, correlates well with the amount of collagen in the lungs, and may be a more sensitive quantitative measure of efficacy for drugs being developed to treat pulmonary fibrosis. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The preclinical model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has incorrectly predicted efficacy for several candidate compounds suggesting that it may be of limited value. As an attempt to improve the predictive nature of this model, integrative bioinformatic approaches were used to compare molecular alterations in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and patients with IPF. Using gene set enrichment analysis we show for the first time that genes differentially expressed during the fibrotic phase of the single challenge bleomycin model were significantly enriched in the expression profiles of IPF patients. The genes that contributed most to the enrichment were largely involved in mitosis, growth factor, and matrix signaling. Interestingly, these same mitotic processes were increased in the expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from rapidly progressing, but not slowly progressing, IPF patients relative to control subjects. The data also indicated that TGF$\beta$ was not the sole mediator responsible for the changes observed in this model since the ALK-5 inhibitor SB525334 effectively attenuated some but not all of the fibrosis associated with this model. Although some would suggest that repetitive bleomycin injuries may more effectively model IPF-like changes, our data do not support this conclusion. Together, these data highlight that a single bleomycin instillation effectively replicates several of the specific pathogenic molecular changes associated with IPF, and may be best used as a model for patients with active disease.},

It offers several advantages over t-test based methods and accepts pre-processed expression datasets produced from a wide variety of platforms. The significance of the detection is assessed by a non-parametric permutation test, and the associated P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) are included in the output alongside the genes that are detected by user-defined criteria. A visualization plot is provided to view actual expression levels for each gene with estimated significance measurements.

Older people in particular have been shown to draw meaning and security from the places in which they live. Qualitative data from multiple conversational interviews held over the period of a year with each of 83 community-dwelling older people in Auckland within the context of a study conducted from 2006 to 2008 are interpreted to explore how older people relate to their social and physical environments, with a specific focus on attachment to place and the meaning of home. The concept of ‘social space' is proposed, to capture the elastic physical, imaginative, emotional and symbolic experiences of and connections to people and place across time and in scope. Talking with older people themselves gave a rich account of attachment to place, social spaces, and well-being. Our participants had strong attachments to their homes and neighbourhoods, extensive participation in ‘beyond spaces', and shrinking social worlds. They did not, however necessarily view changes as negative; instead there was a delicate negotiation of positive and negative aspects, and complex engagement with ‘social space' as a profoundly meaningful construct.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF and whether components of this signature may serve as biomarkers for disease presence and progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the concentrations of 49 proteins in the plasma of 74 patients with IPF and in the plasma of 53 control individuals. We identified a combinatorial signature of five proteins-MMP7, MMP1, MMP8, IGFBP1, and TNFRSF1A-that was sufficient to distinguish patients from controls with a sensitivity of 98.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 92.7{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 98.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 89.9{\%}-100{\%}). Increases in MMP1 and MMP7 were also observed in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from IPF patients. MMP7 and MMP1 plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis and distinguished IPF compared to subacute/chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease that may mimic IPF, with a sensitivity of 96.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 81.0{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 87.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 72.6{\%}-95.7{\%}). We verified our results in an independent validation cohort composed of patients with IPF, familial pulmonary fibrosis, subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD), as well as with control individuals. MMP7 and MMP1 concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to controls in this cohort. Furthermore, MMP7 concentrations were elevated in patients with subclinical ILD and negatively correlated with percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC{\%}) and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments provide the first evidence for a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF to our knowledge. The two main components of this signature, MMP7 and MMP1, are overexpressed in the lung microenvironment and distinguish IPF from other chronic lung diseases. Additionally, increased MMP7 concentration may be indicative of asymptomatic ILD and reflect disease progression.},

These alterations derive from a complex disease process affecting all compartments of the lower respiratory system, from the conducting airways to the lung vasculature. In this article we review the profound alterations in lung mechanics (reduced lung compliance and lung volumes), pulmonary gas exchange (reduced diffusing capacity, increased dead space ventilation, chronic arterial hypoxaemia) and airway physiology (increased cough reflex and increased airway volume), as well as pulmonary haemodynamics related to IPF. The relative contribution of these alterations to exertional limitation and dyspnoea in IPF is discussed.},

abstract = {Intratracheal instillation (IT) of bleomycin is a widely used experimental model for lung fibrosis. In this study we describe the time-course of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice using computer-assisted morphometry. C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a single IT dose of bleomycin or control saline. Animals were killed 3, 6, 14 and 21 days post-IT. Lung injury was evaluated by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, hydroxyproline concentration in the lung, routine light microscopic examination resulting in a semiquantitative morphological index (SMI) of lung injury, and quantitative morphological measurements (fibrosis fraction and alveolar wall area fraction) aided by optimas image analysis software. Changes in BAL fluid attributed to bleomycin treatment include increased total cell count (days 14 and 21), and increased percentage of neutrophils (days 3 and 6) followed by a sustained increase in lymphocytes (days 6, 14 and 21). Hydroxyproline levels increased in bleomycin-treated mice on days 14 and 21. Median SMI grades were significantly elevated on days 3, 14 and 21. Computer-assisted morphometry demonstrated a 3-fold increase in fibrosis fraction and a 1.3-fold increase in wall area fraction in bleomycin-treated mice on day 14, with no further increase on day 21. These data also demonstrate that the most suitable time point for assessing lung fibrosis in this model is 14 days after IT instillation of bleomycin, based on the observation that at 14 days the animals developed extensive fibrosis, but had less variability in the fibrotic response and lower mortality than later at 21 days. Computer-assisted morphometry provides objective and quantitative measurements that are a useful tool for the evaluation of bleomycin-induced lung injury.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of syphilis can be complicated when it is based on diverse clinical manifestations, dark-field microscopy, and serology. In the present study, therefore, we examined the additional clinical value of a Treponema pallidum real-time TaqMan PCR for the detection of primary and secondary syphilis. The additional value of the T. pallidum real-time PCR for the diagnosis of primary syphilis was evaluated by the use of three different algorithms: (i) a head-to-head comparison of the dark-field microscopy result and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result, (ii) comparison of the clinical diagnosis made in a sexually transmitted infection clinic (STI) (including by dark-field microscopy) and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result, and (iii) comparison of the clinical diagnosis made in a general practitioner's office (without dark-field microscopy) and the T. pallidum real-time PCR result. A fourth algorithm was used to determine the performance of the T. pallidum real-time PCR regarding the detection of secondary syphilis. From December 2006 to April 2008, 716 patients with suspected cases of primary syphilis and 133 patients with suspected cases of secondary syphilis were included in the study. A kappa value of 0.601 was found for the agreement between dark-field microscopy and the T. pallidum real-time PCR. Good agreement was found between the T. pallidum real-time PCR and both the diagnosis of the general practitioner (kappa = 0.745) and the diagnosis of the STI clinic (kappa = 0.769). The sensitivity with respect to the STI clinic diagnosis was 72.8{\%}, the specificity was 95.5{\%}, the positive predictive value was 89.2{\%}, and the negative predictive value was 95.0{\%}. The T. pallidum real-time PCR is a fast, efficient, and reliable test for the diagnosis of primary syphilis in an STI outpatient clinic and a general practitioner setting, but it has no added diagnostic value for the diagnosis of secondary syphilis.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which macrophages control the inflammatory response, wound healing, biomaterial-interactions, and tissue regeneration appear to be related to their activation/differentiation states. Studies of macrophage behavior in vitro can be useful for elucidating their mechanisms of action, but it is not clear to what extent the source of macrophages affects their apparent behavior, potentially affecting interpretation of results. Although comparative studies of macrophage behavior with respect to cell source have been conducted, there has been no direct comparison of the three most commonly used cell sources: murine bone marrow, human monocytes from peripheral blood (PB), and the human leukemic monocytic cell line THP-1, across multiple macrophage phenotypes. In this study, we used multivariate discriminant analysis to compare the in vitro expression of genes commonly chosen to assess macrophage phenotype across all three sources of macrophages, as well as those derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), that were polarized towards four distinct phenotypes using the same differentiation protocols: M(LPS,IFN) (aka M1), M(IL4,IL13) (aka M2a), M(IL10) (aka M2c), and M(-) (aka M0) used as control. Several differences in gene expression trends were found among the sources of macrophages, especially between murine bone marrow-derived and human blood-derived M(LPS,IFN) and M(IL4,IL13) macrophages with respect to commonly used phenotype markers like CCR7 and genes associated with angiogenesis and tissue regeneration like FGF2 and MMP9. We found that the genes with the most similar patterns of expression among all sources were CXCL-10 and CXCL-11 for M(LPS,IFN) and CCL17 and CCL22 for M(IL4,IL13). Human PB-derived macrophages and human iPSC-derived macrophages showed similar gene expression patterns among the groups and genes studied here, suggesting that iPSC-derived monocytes have the potential to be used as a reliable cell source of human macrophages for in vitro studies. These findings could help select appropriate markers when testing macrophage behavior in vitro and highlight those markers that may confuse interpretation of results from experiments employing macrophages from different sources.},

abstract = {Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a common complication of long bone fractures. FES is rare but with significant morbidity and occasional fatalities. Studies of animal models of FES are numerous; however, few studies compare inflammatory reactions in multiple organs. The present study investigated the effect of neutral fat and fatty acids, which cause changes in multiple organs and induce FES. Using rats we evaluated the ratio of lung-to-body weight and conducted histological analyses and quantitative analysis of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in the lungs following intravenous administration of neutral fat or fatty acids. Neutral fat increased the ratio of lung-to-body weight, and neutral fat formed emboli in lung capillaries. The levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1$\beta$), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) in the lungs increased after injection of neutral fat and oleic acid. Analysis of the histologic changes revealed that the highest numbers of fat droplets, occluding the capillaries of the lungs, kidney, heart, and brain formed 12. h after the injection of neutral fat and fat droplets gradually diminished 48. h later. Fat droplets were not detected in any organs after the injection of oleic acid. IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$ levels in the lungs were elevated 9-24. h after the injection of neutral fat, although IL-6 levels peaked at 6. h. After injection of oleic acid, peak levels of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and TNF-$\alpha$ were detected at 6. h, and IL-6 again increased in all organs and plasma at 15. h. Neutral fat, but not fatty acids, formed emboli in the capillaries of multiple organs. These findings suggest that neutral fat increased inflammatory cytokine levels by forming emboli in organ capillaries, particularly in the lungs, while oleic acid augmented inflammatory cytokine levels by stimulating endothelial cells of multiple organs.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease. Antiinflammatory therapies, including corticosteroids, are of no benefit. The role of monocytes and macrophages is therefore controversial.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To define the role of monocytes and macrophages during lung fibrogenesis and resolution, and explore the phenotype of the cells involved.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used multiple in vivo depletional strategies, backed up by adoptive transfer techniques. Further studies were performed on samples from patients with IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Depletion of lung macrophages during fibrogenesis reduced pulmonary fibrosis as measured by lung collagen (P = 0.0079); fibrosis score (P = 0.0051); and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for surrogate markers of fibrosis Col1 (P = 0.0083) and a-smooth muscle actin (P = 0.0349). There was an associated reduction in markers of the profibrotic alternative macrophage activation phenotype, Ym1 (P = 0.0179), and Arginase 1. The alternative macrophage marker CD163 was expressed on lung macrophages from patients with IPF. Depletion of Ly6Chi circulating monocytes reduced pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.0052) and the number of Ym1- positive alternatively activated lung macrophages (P = 0.0310). Their adoptive transfer during fibrogenesis exacerbated fibrosis (P = 0.0304); however, adoptively transferred CD45.1 Ly6Chi cells were not found in the lungs of recipient CD45.2 mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of circulating monocytes and lung macrophages during pulmonary fibrosis, and emphasize the importance of the alternatively activated macrophage phenotype. We show that Ly6Chi monocytes facilitate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, but are not obviously engrafted into lungs thereafter. Finally, we provide empirical data to suggest that macrophages may have a resolution-promoting role during the reversible phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Motivation: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in
genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined
by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways.
There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are
typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which
do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of
transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple
molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing.
Results: We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on
functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based
on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects
of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net
regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is
performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on
weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both
simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on
human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly
better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more
pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than
the competing approaches.},

The balance between Th1, Th17, and FoxP3 + CD4 + T cell subsets in sarcoidosis remains unclear. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells, from 30 patients with sarcoidosis, 18 patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, and 15 healthy controls, were investigated with flow cytometry for intracellular expression of FoxP3. In a subset of the patients, expression of the cytokines IL17A and IFN- ? was investigated. The fractions of FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells and Th17 cells were both lower in sarcoidosis compared to controls ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.011 , resp.). The proportion of Th17 cells positive for IFN- ? was greater in sarcoidosis than controls (median 72.4{\%} versus 31{\%}, P = 0.0005 ) and increased with radiologic stage ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.45 , and P = 0.03 ). IFN- ? + Th17 cells were highly correlated with Th1 cells ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.64 , and P = 0.001 ), and the ratio of IFN- ? + Th17/FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells was prominently increased in sarcoidosis. IFN- ? + Th17 cells may represent a pathogenic subset of Th17 cells, yet their expression of IFN- ? could be a consequence of a Th1-polarized cytokine milieu.

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a heterogeneous macrophage response that when experimentally polarized toward alternative forms of activation (M2 macrophages) promotes tissue and functional recovery. There are limited pharmacological therapies that can drive this reparative inflammatory state. In the current study, we used in vitro systems to comprehensively defined markers of macrophages with known pathological (M1) and reparative (M2) properties in SCI. We then used these markers to objectively define the macrophage activation states after SCI in response to delayed azithromycin treatment. Mice were subjected to moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI. Azithromycin or vehicle was administered beginning 30 minutes post-SCI and then daily for 3 or 7 days post injury (dpi). We detected a dose-dependent polarization toward purportedly protective M2 macrophages with daily AZM treatment. Specifically, AZM doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg decreased M1 macrophage gene expression at 3 dpi while the lowest (10 mg/kg) and highest (160 mg/kg) doses increased M2 macrophage gene expression at 7 dpi. Azithromycin has documented immunomodulatory properties and is commonly prescribed to treat infections in SCI individuals. This work demonstrates the utility of objective, comprehensive macrophage gene profiling for evaluating immunomodulatory SCI therapies and highlights azithromycin as a promising agent for SCI treatment. Spinal cord injury (SCI) activates CNS macrophages consisting of endogenous microglia and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells have pathological properties and contribute to neurodegeneration and tissue loss subsequent to the initial mechanical trauma. Activated macrophages also have the potential to promote tissue remodeling and axon regeneration 1–3 and there is growing evidence that transgenic, viral, or transplantation-mediated alterations in macrophage phenotype in SCI can be therapeutic 4 . The development of clinically viable, pharmacological interventions that harness the reparative potential of macrophages responding to SCI, however, remains a challenge facing the SCI community. To date, only one pharmacological agent, meth-ylprednisolone, is approved to treat SCI and its use is controversial. Increasingly, well-tolerated, pharmacological agents with immunomodulatory properties are being sought as therapies for SCI. Azithromycin (AZM) is a semisynthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin with significant immunomodulatory actions independent of is antibacterial properties 5,6},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown etiology with considerable morbidity and mortality. Cigarette smoking is one of the most recognized risk factors for development of IPF. Furthermore, recent work suggests that smoking may have a detrimental effect on survival of patients with IPF. The mechanism by which smoking may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF is largely unknown. However, accumulating evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress might promote disease progression in IPF patients who are current and former smokers. In this review, potential mechanisms by which cigarette smoking affects IPF, the effects of cigarette smoking on accelerated loss of lung function in patients with IPF, key genetic studies evaluating the potential candidate genes and gene-environment (smoking) interaction, diagnosis, and treatment with emphasis on recently closed and ongoing clinical trials are presented.},

abstract = {Lung injury especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be triggered by diverse stimuli, including fatty acids and microbes. ARDS affects thousands of people worldwide each year, presenting high mortality rate and having an economic impact. One of the hallmarks of lung injury is edema formation with alveoli flooding. Animal models are used to study lung injury. Oleic acid-induced lung injury is a widely used model resembling the human disease. The oleic acid has been linked to metabolic and inflammatory diseases; here we focus on lung injury. Firstly, we briefly discuss ARDS and secondly we address the mechanisms by which oleic acid triggers lung injury and inflammation.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease characterized by a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell-dominated alveolitis. As a role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been discussed, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be involved in the initiation of a first immune reaction. We analyzed expression and functional relevance of several TLRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. In parallel, we determined the release of C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 by BAL cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 1 and 2, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR9 expression by BAL cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Chemokine release was measured in BAL cell culture supernatants by ELISA. We found increased TLR9 mRNA expression in patients with sarcoidosis with chest X-ray type I and II and TLR9 protein expression in BAL cells from patients with chest X-ray type II and III. Stimulation with CpG nucleotides increased CXCL10 release by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis type II significantly compared with control subjects or other patients with sarcoidosis. In contrast, no increase in TNF, IL-12p40, or CXCL8 was detected. Spontaneous release of CXCL10, but not CXCL9 or CXCL11, by cultured BAL cells was also highest in cells from patients with chest X-ray type II. We found a significant association between TLR9 expression and CD4(+) lymphocytes in BAL. Our data demonstrate that TLR9 ligands may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis via induction of CXCL10 release in the alveolar macrophages.},

abstract = {Monocytes differentiate into heterogeneous populations of tissue macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that regulate inflammation and immunity. Identifying specific populations of myeloid cells in vivo is problematic, however, because only a limited number of proteins have been used to assign cellular phenotype. Using mass spectrometry and bone marrow-derived cells, we provided a global view of the proteomes of M-CSF-derived macrophages, classically and alternatively activated macrophages, and GM-CSF-derived DCs. Remarkably, the expression levels of half the plasma membrane proteins differed significantly in the various populations of cells derived in vitro. Moreover, the membrane proteomes of macrophages and DCs were more distinct than those of classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Hierarchical cluster and dual statistical analyses demonstrated that each cell type exhibited a robust proteomic signature that was unique. To interrogate the phenotype of myeloid cells in vivo, we subjected elicited peritoneal macrophages harvested from wild-type and GM-CSF-deficient mice to mass spectrometric and functional analysis. Unexpectedly, we found that peritoneal macrophages exhibited many features of the DCs generated in vitro. These findings demonstrate that global analysis of the membrane proteome can help define immune cell phenotypes in vivo.},

abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

abstract = {By regulating the cell number and eliminating harmful cells, programmed cell death plays a critical role in development, homeostasis, and disease. While apoptosis is a recognized form of programmed cell death, necrosis was considered a type of uncontrolled cell death induced by extreme physical or chemical stress. However, recent studies have revealed the existence of a genetically programmed and regulated form of necrosis, termed necroptosis. Necroptosis is defined as necrotic cell death that is dependent on receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). RIPK3, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and a mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) form a multiprotein complex called a necrosome. Although necroptosis generally provides a cell-autonomous host defense, on the other hand, cell rupture caused by necroptosis induces inflammation through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as mitochondrial DNA, HMGB1, and IL-1. Previously, necroptosis was considered an alternative to apoptosis, but it is becoming increasingly clear that necroptosis itself is relevant to clinical disease, independent of apoptosis. According to some recent studies, autophagy, a cellular process for organelle and protein turnover, regulates necroptosis. This review outlines the principal components of necroptosis and provides an overview of the emerging importance of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, infection, and sepsis. We also discuss the molecular relationship between necroptosis and autophagy. Strategies targeting necroptosis may yield novel therapies for pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes in time course RNA-Seq data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of transcriptional regulatory network. However, most of the available methods treat gene expressions at different time points as replicates and test the significance of the mean expression difference between treatments or conditions irrespective of time. They thus fail to identify many DE genes with different profiles across time. In this article, we propose a negative binomial mixed-effect model (NBMM) to identify DE genes in time course RNA-Seq data. In the NBMM, mean gene expression is characterized by a fixed effect, and time dependency is described by random effects. The NBMM is very flexible and can be fitted to both unreplicated and replicated time course RNA-Seq data via a penalized likelihood method. By comparing gene expression profiles over time, we further classify the DE genes into two subtypes to enhance the understanding of expression dynamics. A significance test for detecting DE genes is derived using a Kullback-Leibler distance ratio. Additionally, a significance test for gene sets is developed using a gene set score. RESULTS Simulation analysis shows that the NBMM outperforms currently available methods for detecting DE genes and gene sets. Moreover, our real data analysis of fruit fly developmental time course RNA-Seq data demonstrates the NBMM identifies biologically relevant genes which are well justified by gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method is powerful and efficient to detect biologically relevant DE genes and gene sets in time course RNA-Seq data.},

Results A software pipeline, Flexible Algorithm for Novel Gene set Simulation (FANGS) develops simulated data based on a prostate cancer dataset where the KRAS and TGF-$\beta$ pathways were differentially expressed. The FANGS software is compatible with other datasets and pathways. Comparisons of gene set analysis methods are presented for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Significance Analysis of Function and Expression (SAFE), sigPathway, and Correlation Adjusted Mean RAnk (CAMERA) methods. All gene set analysis methods are tested using gene sets from the MSigDB knowledge base. The false positive rate and power are estimated and presented for comparison. Recommendations are made for the utility of the default settings of methods and each method's sensitivity towards various effect sizes. Conclusions The results of this study provide empirical guidance to users of gene set analysis methods. The FANGS software is available for researchers for continued methods comparisons.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are assumed to be among the main agents that cause severe mastitis disease with clinical signs in dairy cattle. Rapid detection of this disease is so important in order to prevent transmission to other cows and helps to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. With the rapid progress in high-throughput technologies, and accumulation of various kinds of ‘-omics' data in public repositories, there is an opportunity to retrieve, integrate, and reanalyze these resources to improve the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases and to provide mechanistic insights into host resistance in an efficient way. Meta-analysis is a relatively inexpensive option with good potential to increase the statistical power and generalizability of single-study analysis. In the current meta-analysis research, six microarray-based studies that investigate the transcriptome profile of mammary gland tissue after induced mastitis by E. coli infection were used. This meta-analysis not only reinforced the findings in individual studies, but also several novel terms including responses to hypoxia, response to drug, anti-apoptosis and positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter enriched by up-regulated genes. Finally, in order to identify the small sets of genes that are sufficiently informative in E. coli mastitis, the differentially expressed gene introduced by meta-analysis were prioritized by using ten different attribute weighting algorithms. Twelve meta-genes were detected by the majority of attribute weighting algorithms (with weight above 0.7) as most informative genes including CXCL8 (IL8), NFKBIZ, HP, ZC3H12A, PDE4B, CASP4, CXCL2, CCL20, GRO1(CXCL1), CFB, S100A9, and S100A8. Interestingly, the results have been demonstrated that all of these genes are the key genes in the immune response, inflammation or mastitis. The Decision tree models efficiently discovered the best combination of the meta-genes as bio-signature and confirmed that some of the top-ranked genes -ZC3H12A, CXCL2, GRO, CFB- as biomarkers for E. coli mastitis (with the accuracy 83{\%} in average). This research properly indicated that by combination of two novel data mining tools, meta-analysis and machine learning, increased power to detect most informative genes that can help to improve the diagnosis and treatment strategies for E. coli associated with mastitis in cattle.},

abstract = {Innate immune cells are complex systems that can be simultaneously activated in a variety of ways. Common methods currently used to estimate the response of innate immune cells to stimuli are usually biased toward a single mode of activation. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of designing an assay based on unbiased proteome analysis that would be capable of predicting the complex response of the innate immune system to various challenges. Monocytes were used as representative cells of the innate immune system. The underlying hypothesis was that their proteome response to different activating molecules would reflect the immunogenicity of these molecules. To identify the main modes of response, we treated the human monocytic THP-1 cell line with nine different stimuli. Differentiation and activation were determined to be the two major modes of monocyte response, with PMA causing the strongest differentiation and Pam3CSK4 causing the strongest proinflammatory activation. The established assay was applied to characterize the monocyte response to epidermal growth factor peptide containing isoaspartate, which induced differentiation but not proinflammatory activation. Because of its versatility, robustness, and specificity, this new assay is likely to find a niche among the more established immunological methods. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

However, significant diversity in module gene content for specific cell types is associated with heterogeneity in their perfor-mance. In order to rank modules that best reflect their purported association, we have gen-erated the modular discrimination index (MDI) score that assesses expression of each module in the target cell type relative to other cells. We demonstrate that MDI scores predict modules that best reflect independently validated differences in cellular composition, and correlate with the covariance between cell numbers and module expression in human blood and tissue samples. Our analyses demonstrate that MDI scores provide an ordinal summary statistic that reliably ranks the accuracy of gene expression modules for deconvolution of cell type abundance in transcriptional data.},

abstract = {Macrophages are innate immune cells which can react to a large number of environmental stimuli thanks to a high degree of plasticity. These cells are involved in a variety of tissue functions in homeostasis, and they play essential roles in pathological contexts. Macrophages' activation state, which determines their functional orientation, is strongly influenced by the cellular environment. A large body of macrophage literature is devoted to better defining polarizations from a molecular viewpoint. It is now accepted that a multidimensional model of polarization is needed to grasp the broad phenotype repertoire controlled by environmental signals. The study presented here aimed, among other goals, to provide a molecular signature of various polarizations in human macrophages at the protein level to better define the different macrophage activation states. To study the proteome in human monocyte-derived macrophages as a function of their polarization state, we used a label-free quantification approach on in-gel fractionated and LysC/Trypsin digested proteins. In total, 5102 proteins were identified and quantified for all polarization states. New polarization-specific markers were identified and validated. Because oxygen tension is an important environmental parameter in tissues, we explored how environmental oxygen tension, at either atmospheric composition (18.6{\%} O2) or "tissue normoxia" (3{\%} O2), affected our classification of macrophage polarization. The comparative results revealed new polarization-specific makers which suggest that environmental oxygen levels should be taken into account when characterizing macrophage activation states. The proteomic screen revealed various polarization-specific proteins and oxygen sensors in human macrophages. One example is arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), an IL4/IL13 polarization-specific protein, which was upregulated under low oxygen conditions and is associated with an increase in the rate of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. These results illustrate the need to consider physicochemical parameters like oxygen level when studying macrophage polarization, so as to correctly assess their functions in tissue.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Differences in the lung microbial community influence idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progression. Whether the lung microbiome influences IPF host defense remains unknown. OBJECTIVES To explore the host immune response and microbial interaction in IPF as they relate to progression-free survival (PFS), fibroblast function, and leukocyte phenotypes. METHODS Paired microarray gene expression data derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data from bronchoalveolar lavage obtained as part of the COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with Biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-Progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) study were used to conduct association pathway analyses. The responsiveness of paired lung fibroblasts to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulation by CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) was integrated into microbiome-gene expression association analyses for a subset of individuals. The relationship between associated pathways and circulating leukocyte phenotypes was explored by flow cytometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Down-regulation of immune response pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, Toll-, and RIG1-like receptor pathways, was associated with worse PFS. Ten of the 11 PFS-associated pathways correlated with microbial diversity and individual genus, with species accumulation curve richness as a hub. Higher species accumulation curve richness was significantly associated with inhibition of NODs and TLRs, whereas increased abundance of Streptococcus correlated with increased NOD-like receptor signaling. In a network analysis, expression of up-regulated signaling pathways was strongly associated with decreased abundance of operational taxonomic unit 1341 (OTU1341; Prevotella) among individuals with fibroblasts responsive to CpG-ODN stimulation. The expression of TLR signaling pathways was also linked to CpG-ODN responsive fibroblasts, OTU1341 (Prevotella), and Shannon index of microbial diversity in a network analysis. Lymphocytes expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 CD8 significantly correlated with OTU1348 (Staphylococcus). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that host-microbiome interactions influence PFS and fibroblast responsiveness.},

abstract = {Mononuclear phagocytes play a fundamental role in the tissue homeostasis and innate defenses against viruses and other microbial pathogens. In addition, they are likely involved in several steps of cancer development. Circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages are target cells of viral infections, including human cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 8, and the HIV, and alterations of their functional and phenotypic properties are likely involved in many tissue-degenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis and cancer. Different tissue microenvironments as well as their pathological alterations can profoundly affect the polarization state of macrophages toward the extreme phenotypes conventionally termed M1 and M2. Thus, targeting disease-associated macrophages is considered a potential approach particularly in the context of cancer-associated tumor-associated macrophages, supporting malignant cell growth and progression toward a metastatic phenotype. Of note is the fact that tumor-associated macrophages isolated from established tumors display phenotypic and functional features similar to those of in vitro-derived M2-polarized cells. Concerning HIV-1 infection, viral eradication strategies in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy should also consider the possibility to deplete, at least transiently, certain mononuclear phagocytes subsets, although the possibility of distinguishing those that are either infected or pathogenically altered remains a goal of future research. In the present review, we will focus on the recent literature concerning the role of human macrophage polarization in viral infections and cancer.},

@article{Khoo2009,
abstract = {The understanding of how cellular productivity is modulated in cell lines is of significant importance in the biopharmaceutical industry. Often, single molecular mechanisms fail to fully explain how specific antibody productivity is enhanced during proliferation arrest. Previously, we reported that certain physiological changes occur when proliferation is arrested by p21(CIP1) over expression. In this work, we correlate physiological and molecular factors to enhance antibody productivity. Using biomass, cell volume and total cellular protein content as a basis for determining specific productivity, it was found that total cellular protein correlated best with cellular productivity. This meant that there was no preferential increase in antibody production relative to cellular proteins in arrested cultures. However, molecular analysis of mRNA transcription and stability indicated that both processes were altered in arrested cultures resulting in up to threefold increased heavy chain mRNA levels. While flow cytometric analysis revealed that arrested cells had elevated translational capacity for both heavy and light chains, the heavy to light chain polypeptide ratio was 10-50{\%} higher than in the control. This resulted in a lower extracellular accumulation of light chains and a better utilization of cellular resources for the formation of complete antibodies. Active transcriptional regulation of heavy and light chain mRNA and the modulation of translational activities play a vital role in the modulation of overall antibody productivity of these cells. The combined effect of heavy chain mRNA enhancement and the increased cellular assembly capacity was determined to effectively increase specific productivity.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity and latent variables are now widely recognized as major sources of bias and variability in high-throughput experiments. The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects-when samples are processed on different days, in different groups or by different people. However, there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for known batch effects with the ComBat function and adjustment for batch and latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva function.},

abstract = {ASPD is a new curated database that incorporates data on full-length proteins, protein domains and peptides that were obtained through in vitro directed evolution processes (mainly by means of phage display). At present, the ASPD database contains data on 195 selection experiments, which were described in 112 original papers. For each experiment, the following information is given: (i) description of the target for binding, (ii) description of the protein or peptide which serves as the template for library construction and description of the native protein which binds the target, (iii) links to the major proteomic databases (SWISS-PROT, PDB, PROSITE and ENZYME), (iv) keywords referring to the biological significance of the experiment, (v) aligned sequences of proteins or peptides retrieved through in vitro evolution and relevant native or constructed sequences, (vi) the number of rounds of selection/amplification and (vii) the number of occurrences of clones with each sequence. The literature data include a full reference, a link to the MEDLINE database and the name of the corresponding author with his email address. ASPD has a user-friendly interface which allows for simple queries using the names of proteins and ligands, as well as keywords describing the biological role of the interaction studied, and also for queries based on authors' names. It is also possible to access the database by means of the SRS system, allowing complex queries. There is a BLAST search tool against the ASPD for looking directly for homologous sequences. Research tools of the ASPD allow the analysis of pairwise correlations in the sequences of proteins and peptides selected against one target. The URL for the ASPD database is http://www.sgi.sscc.ru/mgs/gnw/aspd/.},

abstract = {A large variety of fungi are present in the environment, among which a proportion colonizes the human body, usually without causing any harm. However, depending on the host immune status, commensals can become opportunistic pathogens that induce diseases ranging from superficial non-harmful infection to life-threatening systemic disease. The interplay between the host and the fungal commensal flora is being orchestrated by an efficient recognition of the microorganisms, which in turn ensures a proper balance between tolerance of the normal fungal flora and induction of immune defense mechanisms when invasion occurs. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a significant role in maintaining this balance due to their capacity to sense fungi and induce host responses such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines involved in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In the present review, we will discuss the most recent findings regarding the recognition of Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus and the different types of immune cells that play a role in antifungal host defense.},

Therapeutic options for PF are limited and there is therefore a significant unmet clinical need. The recent resurgent interest in macrophage biology has led to a new understanding of lung macrophage origins, biology, and phenotypes. In this review we discuss fibrotic mechanisms and focus on the role of macrophages during fibrotic lung disease. Data from both human and murine studies are reviewed, highlighting novel macrophage-orientated biomarkers for disease diagnosis and potential targets for future anti-fibrotic therapies.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

Tissue damage not only induces inflammation in general, it also determines the type and polarization of inflammation by recruiting and activating a variety of different cells types of the innate and adaptive immune system. This review focuses on the pathways leading from tissue damage to inflammation, from inflammation to fibrosis and from fibrosis to function. It covers the pro- and antifibrotic properties of immunological mediators released from T cells, monocytes/macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, basophils and eosinophils and takes into account that extracellular matrix proteins are not only produced by mesenchymal fibroblasts but also by other cell types, especially infiltrating hematopoietic cells. The special requirements for activation and recruitment of these so called fibrocytes are described in detail.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat curable diseases such as germinative tumors and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The major limitation of bleomycin therapy is pulmonary toxicity, which can be life threatening in up to 10{\%} of patients receiving the drug. The mechanism of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP) involves oxidative damage, relative deficiency of the deactivating enzyme bleomycin hydrolase, genetic susceptibility, and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, BIP can progress to lung fibrosis. The diagnosis of BIP is established by the combination of systemic symptoms, radiological and histological findings, and respiratory function tests abnormalities, while other disorders should be excluded. Although the diagnosis and pathophysiology of this disease have been better characterized over the past few years, there is no effective therapy for the disease. In general, the clinical picture is extremely complex. A greater understanding of the BIP pathogenesis may lead to the development of new agents capable of preventing or even treating the injury already present. Physicians who prescribe bleomycin must be aware of the potential pulmonary toxicity, especially in the presence of risk factors. This review will focus on BIP, mainly regarding recent advances and perspectives in diagnosis and treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {RATIONALE Differences in the lung microbial community influence idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progression. Whether the lung microbiome influences IPF host defense remains unknown. OBJECTIVES To explore the host immune response and microbial interaction in IPF as they relate to progression-free survival (PFS), fibroblast function, and leukocyte phenotypes. METHODS Paired microarray gene expression data derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data from bronchoalveolar lavage obtained as part of the COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with Biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-Progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) study were used to conduct association pathway analyses. The responsiveness of paired lung fibroblasts to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulation by CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) was integrated into microbiome-gene expression association analyses for a subset of individuals. The relationship between associated pathways and circulating leukocyte phenotypes was explored by flow cytometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Down-regulation of immune response pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, Toll-, and RIG1-like receptor pathways, was associated with worse PFS. Ten of the 11 PFS-associated pathways correlated with microbial diversity and individual genus, with species accumulation curve richness as a hub. Higher species accumulation curve richness was significantly associated with inhibition of NODs and TLRs, whereas increased abundance of Streptococcus correlated with increased NOD-like receptor signaling. In a network analysis, expression of up-regulated signaling pathways was strongly associated with decreased abundance of operational taxonomic unit 1341 (OTU1341; Prevotella) among individuals with fibroblasts responsive to CpG-ODN stimulation. The expression of TLR signaling pathways was also linked to CpG-ODN responsive fibroblasts, OTU1341 (Prevotella), and Shannon index of microbial diversity in a network analysis. Lymphocytes expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 CD8 significantly correlated with OTU1348 (Staphylococcus). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that host-microbiome interactions influence PFS and fibroblast responsiveness.},

abstract = {Background TH2 cells can further differentiate into dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells. The presence of dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in the airways and their effect on asthma severity are unknown. Objective We sought to study dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from asthmatic patients, examine their response to glucocorticoids, and define their relevance for disease severity. Methods Bronchoscopy and lavage were performed in 52 asthmatic patients and 25 disease control subjects. TH2 and TH2/TH17 cells were analyzed by using multicolor flow cytometry and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytokines were assayed by means of ELISA. Results Dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells were present at a higher frequency in BAL fluid from asthmatic patients compared with numbers seen in disease control subjects. High-level IL-4 production was typically accompanied by high-level IL-17 production and coexpression of GATA3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor $\gamma$t. Increased presence of TH2/TH17 cells was associated with increased IL-17 production in lavage fluid. TH2/TH17 cell counts and IL-17 production correlated with PC20 for methacholine, eosinophil counts, and FEV1. TH2/TH17 cells, unlike TH2 cells, were resistant to dexamethasone-induced cell death. They expressed higher levels of mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1, a molecule that induces glucocorticoid resistance. On the basis of the dominance of BAL fluid TH2 or TH2/TH17 cells, we identified 3 subgroups of asthma: TH2predominant, TH2/TH17predominant, and TH2/TH17low. The TH2/TH17predominant subgroup manifested the most severe form of asthma, whereas the TH2/TH17low subgroup had the mildest asthma. Conclusion Asthma is associated with a higher frequency of dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in BAL fluid. The TH2/TH17predominant subgroup of asthmatic patients manifested glucocorticoid resistance in vitro. They also had the greatest airway obstruction and hyperreactivity compared with the TH2predominant and TH2/TH17low subgroups.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 the American Physiological Society.Nitrogen mustard (NM) is a vesicant that causes lung injury and fibrosis, accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we analyzed the spleen as a source of these cells. Splenectomized (SPX) and sham control rats were treated intratracheally with NM (0.125 mg/kg) or PBS control. Macrophage responses were analyzed 1–7 days later. Splenectomy resulted in an increase in lung macrophages expressing CCR2, but a decrease in ATR-1a+ cells, receptors important in bone marrow and spleen monocyte trafficking, respectively. Splenectomy was also associated with an increase in proinflammatory M1 (iNOS+, CD11b+CD43+) macrophages in lungs of NM-treated rats, as well as greater upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression. Conversely, a decrease in CD11b+CD43+ M2 macrophages was observed in SPX rats, with no changes in CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, or YM-1+ M2 macrophages, suggesting distinct origins of M2 subpopulations responding to NM. Macrophage expression of M2 genes including IL-10, ApoE, PTX-2, PTX-3, 5-HT2a, and 5-HT7 was also reduced in NM-treated SPX rats compared with shams, indicating impaired M2 activity. Changes in lung macrophages responding to NM as a consequence of splenectomy were correlated with exacerbated tissue injury and more rapid fibrogenesis. These data demonstrate that the spleen is a source of a subset of M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory activity; moreover, in their absence, proinflammatory/ cytotoxic M1 macrophages predominate in the lung, resulting in heightened pathology. Understanding the origin of macrophages and characterizing their phenotype after vesicant exposure may lead to more targeted therapeutics aimed at reducing toxicity and disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

However, emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) represent one important source of these cells. As we discuss here, processes similar to the EMTs associated with embryo implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development are appropriated and subverted by chronically inflamed tissues and neoplasias. The identification of the signaling pathways that lead to activation of EMT programs during these disease processes is providing new insights into the plasticity of cellular phenotypes and possible therapeutic interventions},

abstract = {Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissue or organ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of proteases known to regulate the turn-over of ECM and so they are suggested to be important in tissue remodelling observed during fibrogenic process associated with chronic inflammation. Tissue remodelling is the result of an imbalance in the equilibrium of the normal processes of synthesis and degradation of ECM components markedly controlled by the MMPs/TIMP imbalance. We previously showed an association of the differences in collagen deposition in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with a reduced molar pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. Using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) preclinical model of liver fibrosis in mice, we observed a significant increase in collagen deposition with increased expression and release of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 both at 24 h and 3 weeks later. This suggests an early altered regulation of matrix turnover involved in the development of fibrosis. We also demonstrated an activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway associated with the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling in the development of experimental fibrosis both in lung and liver. This was also associated with an increased expression of purinergic receptors mainly P2X7 Finally, these observations emphasize those effective therapies for these disorders must be given early in the natural history of the disease, prior to the development of tissue remodelling and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in type 2 immunity. Mice deficient in ST2, a receptor for the latest member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, have impaired type 2 immune responses. We therefore reasoned that IL-33/ST2 signaling may be involved in the differentiation and activation of AAM during airway inflammation. We report here that IL-33 changed the quiescent phenotype of alveolar macrophages toward an AAM phenotype that expressed mannose receptor, IL-4Ralpha, and produced high levels of CCL24 and CCL17 in an IL-13-dependent manner during IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Neutralization of AAM-derived CCL24 led to an amelioration of IL-33-induced eosinophilia in the lungs. Moreover, depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Additionally, the attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation in ST2(-/-) mice was associated with a decrease in AAM differentiation. In vitro, IL-33 amplified IL-13-induced polarization of alveolar- and bone marrow-derived macrophage toward an AAM phenotype by increasing the expression of arginase I, Ym1, as well as the production of CCL24 and CCL17. IL-13/IL-4Ralpha signaling was crucial for IL-33-driven AAM amplification by inducing the expression of ST2L. Finally, we showed that IL-33 was more abundantly expressed in the lung epithelial cells of asthma patients than those from healthy controls, suggesting that IL-33 may be involved in lung macrophage activation in clinical asthma. Taken together, we demonstrate here that IL-33/ST2 plays a significant role in the amplification of AAM polarization and chemokine production which contribute to innate and Ag-induced airway inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to current therapy and often leads to death. However, the rate of disease progression differs among patients. We hypothesized that comparing the gene expression profiles between patients with stable disease and those in which the disease progressed rapidly will lead to biomarker discovery and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To begin to address this hypothesis, we applied Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate lung expression profiles from diagnostic surgical lung biopsies in 6 individuals with relatively stable (or slowly progressive) IPF and 6 individuals with progressive IPF (based on changes in DLCO and FVC over 12 months). Our results indicate that this comprehensive lung IPF SAGE transcriptome is distinct from normal lung tissue and other chronic lung diseases. To identify candidate markers of disease progression, we compared the IPF SAGE profiles in stable and progressive disease, and identified a set of 102 transcripts that were at least 5-fold up regulated and a set of 89 transcripts that were at least 5-fold down regulated in the progressive group (P-value{\textless}/=0.05). The over expressed genes included surfactant protein A1, two members of the MAPK-EGR-1-HSP70 pathway that regulate cigarette-smoke induced inflammation, and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated), a gene not previously implicated in IPF. Interestingly, 26 of the up regulated genes are also increased in lung adenocarcinomas and have low or no expression in normal lung tissue. More importantly, we defined a SAGE molecular expression signature of 134 transcripts that sufficiently distinguished relatively stable from progressive IPF. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of diagnosis could prove helpful in predicting the likelihood of disease progression or possibly understanding the biological activity of IPF.},

abstract = {The clinical and commercial success of monoclonal antibodies has led to the need for very large-scale production in mammalian cell culture. This has resulted in rapid expansion of global manufacturing capacity [1], an increase in size of reactors (up to 20,000??L) and a greatly increased effort to improve process efficiency with concomitant manufacturing cost reduction. This has been particularly successful in the upstream part of the process where productivity of cell cultures has improved 100??fold in the last 15??years. This success has resulted from improvements in expression technology and from process optimisation, especially the development of fed-batch cultures. In addition to improving process/cost efficiencies, a second key area has been reducing the time taken to develop processes and produce the first material required for clinical testing and proof-of-principle. Cell line creation is often the slowest step in this stage of process development. This article will review the technologies currently used to make monoclonal antibodies with particular emphasis on mammalian cell culture. Likely future trends are also discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

During longer interactions, the ergonomic factors of interaction systems have to be taken into consideration. Using the full interaction space may require considerable motion of the arms and upper body over a prolonged period of time, potentially causing fatigue. In this work, we present Curved, a large-surface interaction device, whose shape is designed based on the natural movement of an outstretched arm. It is able to track one or two hands above or on its surface by using 32 capacitive proximity sensors. Supporting both touch and mid-air interaction can enable more versatile modes of use. We use image processing methods for tracking the user's hands and classify gestures based on their motion. Virtual reality is a potential use case for such interaction systems and was chosen for our demonstration application. We conducted a study with ten users to test the gesture tracking performance, as well as user experience and user preference for the adjustable system parameters.},

abstract = {Grooming might be a resource that is offered in exchange for some benefit (e.g. access to a feeding site or coalitionary support) or it might be a mechanism for building and servicing social relationships, whose function, in turn, is to facilitate the exchange of resources and services. Bi-directional (or simultaneous mutual) grooming is unusually common among chimpanzees (though rare in other primates) and we suggest that this might be because it is an especially strong indicator of social bonding. Because the bonding role of bi-directional grooming offers substantially different predictions from the interpretation offered by the models based on reciprocal altruism (RA), we use a critical tests methodology (i.e. tests that unequivocally support one hypothesis at the expense of the other) to differentiate between the bonding and RA hypotheses. We use data on the dynamics of grooming interactions from a captive group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to show that dominant individuals tolerated the individuals with whom they performed bi-directional grooming more than they did those who typically provided them unidirectional grooming. Dominants rejected and terminated grooming sessions more often with the individuals who provided them with mostly unidirectional grooming than with those with whom they groomed bi-directionally. In addition, animals engaged in bi-directional grooming more often with both relatives and those with whom they were often in proximity. These results support the bonding model of mutually reciprocated grooming at the expense of the RA model, and suggest that, at least in chimpanzees, simultaneous mutual grooming may play a particularly important role in social bonding.},

We demonstrate that MDI scores predict modules that best reflect independently validated differences in cellular composition, and correlate with the covariance between cell numbers and module expression in human blood and tissue samples.

abstract = {Gene set analysis methods, which consider predefined groups of genes in the analysis of genomic data, have been successfully applied for analyzing gene expression data in cross-sectional studies. The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) introduced here is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates. It allows to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When biological conditions are compared, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. The interest of the method is illustrated by its application to two real life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial), and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis corrected for multiple testing as well as a standard a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series both failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. When applied to the second illustrative data set, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets finally found to be linked with the influenza vaccine too although they were found to be associated to the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses. In our simulation study TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is made available for the community through an R package.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of PCR-amplified taxonomic markers (like the 16S rRNA gene) has enabled a new level of analysis of complex bacterial communities known as microbiomes. Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or microbial composition of communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. Common approaches use a notion of 97{\%} similarity and normalize the data by subsampling to equalize library sizes. In this paper, we show that statistical models allow more accurate abundance estimates. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, including both parameteric and nonparametric methods. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2 and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests, partial least squares and linear models as well as nonparametric testing using community networks and the ggnetwork package.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with aberrant expression of developmental pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh). As Hh signalling contributes to multiple pro-fibrotic processes, Hh inhibition may represent a therapeutic option for IPF. However, no non-invasive biomarkers are available to monitor lung Hh activity. METHODS We assessed gene and protein expression in IPF and control lung biopsies, mouse lung, fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with sonic hedgehog (SHh), and plasma in IPF patients versus controls, and cancer patients before and after treatment with vismodegib, a Hh inhibitor. RESULTS Lung tissue from IPF patients exhibited significantly greater expression of Hh-related genes versus controls. The gene most significantly upregulated in both IPF lung biopsies and fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with SHh was CXCL14, which encodes a soluble secreted chemokine whose expression is inhibited in vitro by the addition of vismodegib. CXCL14 expression was induced by SHh overexpression in mouse lung. Circulating CXCL14 protein levels were significantly higher in plasma from IPF patients than controls. In cancer patients, circulating CXCL14 levels were significantly reduced upon vismodegib treatment. CONCLUSIONS CXCL14 is a systemic biomarker that could be used to identify IPF patients with increased Hh pathway activity and monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of Hh antagonist therapy in IPF.

abstract = {Few studies have addressed the importance of vascular remodeling in the lung during the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. For fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix to occur, there must be a geometric increase in neovascularization. We hypothesized that net angiogenesis during the pathogenesis of fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis are dependent in part upon an overexpression of the angiogenic CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). To test this hypothesis, we measured MIP-2 by specific ELISA in whole lung homogenates in either bleomycin-treated or control CBA/J mice and correlated these levels with lung hydroxyproline. We found that lung tissue from mice treated with bleomycin, compared with that from saline-treated controls, demonstrated a significant increase in the presence of MIP-2 that was correlated to a greater angiogenic response and total lung hydroxyproline content. Neutralizing anti-MIP-2 Abs inhibited the angiogenic activity of day 16 bleomycin-treated lung specimens using an in vivo angiogenesis bioassay. Furthermore, when MIP-2 was depleted in vivo by passive immunization, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced without a change in the presence of pulmonary neutrophils, fibroblast proliferation, or collagen gene expression. This was also paralleled by a reduction in angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that the angiogenic CXC chemokine, MIP-2, is an important factor that regulates angiogenesis/fibrosis in pulmonary fibrosis.},

Despite the attempts to establish a link between them, the shared biological mechanisms are yet to be characterized. An integrated gene expression meta-analysis of five independent publicly available microarray data of the three diseases was conducted to identify shared gene expression signatures and overlapping biological processes. Using INMEX bioinformatic tool, based on combined Effect Size (ES) approaches, we identified a total of 1,157 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (697 overexpressed and 460 underexpressed genes) shared between the three diseases. EnrichR tool's rich library was used for comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis which revealed “mRNA Splicing” and “SUMO E3 ligases SUMOylate target proteins” among the most enriched terms. Network based meta- analysis identified MYC and FN1 to be the most highly ranked hub genes. Our results reveal that the alterations in biomarkers of the coagulation cascade like F2R, PROS1, SELPLG and ITGB2 were common between the three diseases. Interestingly, the study has generated a novel database of candidate genetic markers, pathways and transcription factors shared between thrombosis and MPDs, which might aid in the development of prognostic therapeutic biomarkers.

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are assumed to be among the main agents that cause severe mastitis disease with clinical signs in dairy cattle. Rapid detection of this disease is so important in order to prevent transmission to other cows and helps to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. With the rapid progress in high-throughput technologies, and accumulation of various kinds of ‘-omics' data in public repositories, there is an opportunity to retrieve, integrate, and reanalyze these resources to improve the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases and to provide mechanistic insights into host resistance in an efficient way. Meta-analysis is a relatively inexpensive option with good potential to increase the statistical power and generalizability of single-study analysis. In the current meta-analysis research, six microarray-based studies that investigate the transcriptome profile of mammary gland tissue after induced mastitis by E. coli infection were used. This meta-analysis not only reinforced the findings in individual studies, but also several novel terms including responses to hypoxia, response to drug, anti-apoptosis and positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter enriched by up-regulated genes. Finally, in order to identify the small sets of genes that are sufficiently informative in E. coli mastitis, the differentially expressed gene introduced by meta-analysis were prioritized by using ten different attribute weighting algorithms. Twelve meta-genes were detected by the majority of attribute weighting algorithms (with weight above 0.7) as most informative genes including CXCL8 (IL8), NFKBIZ, HP, ZC3H12A, PDE4B, CASP4, CXCL2, CCL20, GRO1(CXCL1), CFB, S100A9, and S100A8. Interestingly, the results have been demonstrated that all of these genes are the key genes in the immune response, inflammation or mastitis. The Decision tree models efficiently discovered the best combination of the meta-genes as bio-signature and confirmed that some of the top-ranked genes -ZC3H12A, CXCL2, GRO, CFB- as biomarkers for E. coli mastitis (with the accuracy 83{\%} in average). This research properly indicated that by combination of two novel data mining tools, meta-analysis and machine learning, increased power to detect most informative genes that can help to improve the diagnosis and treatment strategies for E. coli associated with mastitis in cattle.},

abstract = {Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissue or organ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of proteases known to regulate the turn-over of ECM and so they are suggested to be important in tissue remodelling observed during fibrogenic process associated with chronic inflammation. Tissue remodelling is the result of an imbalance in the equilibrium of the normal processes of synthesis and degradation of ECM components markedly controlled by the MMPs/TIMP imbalance. We previously showed an association of the differences in collagen deposition in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with a reduced molar pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. Using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) preclinical model of liver fibrosis in mice, we observed a significant increase in collagen deposition with increased expression and release of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 both at 24 h and 3 weeks later. This suggests an early altered regulation of matrix turnover involved in the development of fibrosis. We also demonstrated an activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway associated with the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling in the development of experimental fibrosis both in lung and liver. This was also associated with an increased expression of purinergic receptors mainly P2X7 Finally, these observations emphasize those effective therapies for these disorders must be given early in the natural history of the disease, prior to the development of tissue remodelling and fibrosis.},

Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data.

abstract = {I n an interesting paper, Scotton et al. (1) reported the ef-fects of IL-13 on the transcriptional profile of human monocytes. Comparing their results with studies analyz-ing the profile induced by IL-4 in murine macrophages (2, 3), the authors notice some differences, giving as examples up-reg-ulation of Ym1 and arginase-1 in murine macrophages, but not in human monocytes. The authors suggest these differences re-flect the fact that IL-4 and IL-13 are highly similar, yet different molecules. Besides overlapping effects with IL-4, IL-13 indeed has documented nonredundant functions and effects (4, 5). However, when comparing results obtained in murine macro-phages to human monocytes, differences between monocytes and differentiated macrophages, as well as interspecies differ-ences, may be involved. Indeed, human monocytes and mono-cyte-derived macrophages exhibit differences in their response to IL-4 and IL-13 (6). Moreover, we and others recently docu-mented that, similar to IL-13, IL-4 does not induce arginase-1 in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (7, 8), in contrast to murine macrophages, where the arginine me-tabolism is even one of the discriminative criteria between so-called alternatively and classically activated macrophages (9). Furthermore, in human monocytes, under conditions inducing mannose receptor and macrophage galactose-type C-type lec-tin, markers for IL-4/IL-13-induced, alternatively activated macrophages (7), we have not detected induction by IL-4 and IL-13 of eosinophil chemotactic cytokine, the closest human homolog of mouse Ym1 by sequence identity (Fig. 1). Overall, next to similarities, murine and human alternatively activated myeloid cells exhibit distinct differences. These should be taken into consideration to make optimal use of information obtained from murine models, and to relate it to the human situation.},

A well-defined flow cytometry panel for myeloid cells in human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a flow cytometry-based panel for human BAL and lung tissue. We obtained and performed flow cytometry/sorting on human BAL cells and lung tissue. Confocal images were obtained from lung tissue using antibodies for cluster of differentiation (CD)206, CD169, and E cadherin. We defined a multicolor flow panel for human BAL and lung tissue that identifies major leukocyte populations. These include macrophage (CD206(+)) subsets and other CD206(-) leukocytes. The CD206(-) cells include: (1) three monocyte (CD14(+)) subsets, (2) CD11c(+) dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(+), HLA-DR(+)), (3) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(+)), and (4) other granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils). Using this panel on human lung tissue, we defined two populations of pulmonary macrophages: CD169(+) and CD169(-) macrophages. In lung tissue, CD169(-) macrophages were a prominent cell type. Using confocal microscopy, CD169(+) macrophages were located in the alveolar space/airway, defining them as alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CD169(-) macrophages were associated with airway/alveolar epithelium, consistent with interstitial-associated macrophages. We defined a flow cytometry panel in human BAL and lung tissue that allows identification of multiple immune cell types and delineates alveolar from interstitial-associated macrophages. This study has important implications for defining myeloid cells in human lung samples.},

abstract = {T helper 1 responses are typically proinflammatory, while Th2 responses have been considered regulatory. Interestingly, Th2 responses characterize a number of pulmonary diseases, many of which terminate in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. We developed a mouse model using Schistosoma mansoni eggs and cytokine-deficient mice to induce highly polarized Th1- or Th2-type inflammation in the lung. In this study, we examined the pathology and cytokine profiles in Th1- and Th2-polarized environments and used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to decipher the genes responsible for these effects. We further elaborated on the results using IL-10- and IL-13-deficient mice because these cytokines are believed to be the central regulators of Th2-associated pathology. We found that the Th1-polarized mice developed small granulomas with less fibrosis while expressing genes characteristic of tissue damage. Th2-polarized mice, in contrast, formed large granulomas with massive collagen deposition and up-regulated genes associated-with wound healing, specifically, arginase, collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMP. In addition, several members of the chitinase-like family were up-regulated in the lung following egg challenge. We also developed a method of defining the net collagen deposition using the expression profiles of several collagen, MMP, and tissue inhibitors of MMP genes. We found that Th1-polarized mice did not elaborate collagens or MMPs and therefore did not have a significant capacity for repair in this model. Thus, Th1-mediated inflammation is characterized by tissue damage, while Th2 directs wound healing and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by progressive decline in lung function, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Current concepts of the pathogenesis of IPF primarily center on dysregulated epithelial cell repair and altered epithelial-mesenchymal communication and extracellular matrix deposition following chronic exposure to cigarette smoke or environmental toxins. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed towards the role of the intercellular junctional complex in determining the specific properties of epithelia in pulmonary diseases. Additionally, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that specific genetic variants predictive of epithelial cell dysfunction may confer susceptibility to the development of sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A number of genetic disorders linked to pulmonary fibrosis and familial interstitial pneumonias are associated with loss of epithelial integrity. However, the potential links between extra-pulmonary clinical syndromes associated with defects in epithelial cells and the development of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. Here, we report a case of hereditary muco-epithelial dysplasia that presented with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema on high-resolution computed tomography. This case illustrates a more generalizable concept of epithelial disintegrity in the development of fibrotic lung diseases, which is explored in greater detail in this review article.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Abstract: A sense of belonging or attachment to place is believed to help maintain a sense of identity and well-being, and to facilitate successful adjustments in old age. Older people in particular have been shown to draw meaning and security from the places in which they live. Qualitative data from multiple conversational interviews held over the period of a year with each of 83 community-dwelling older people in Auckland within the context of a study conducted from 2006 to 2008 are interpreted to explore how older people relate to their social and physical environments, with a specific focus on attachment to place and the meaning of home. The concept of ‘social space' is proposed, to capture the elastic physical, imaginative, emotional and symbolic experiences of and connections to people and place across time and in scope. Talking with older people themselves gave a rich account of attachment to place, social spaces, and well-being. Our participants had strong attachments to their homes and neighbourhoods, extensive participation in ‘beyond spaces', and shrinking social worlds. They did not, however necessarily view changes as negative; instead there was a delicate negotiation of positive and negative aspects, and complex engagement with ‘social space' as a profoundly meaningful construct.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oleic acid has been used to induce acute lung injury (ALI) in animals. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the blood level of oleic acid was increased. The mechanism and therapeutic regimen of ARDS and oleic acid-induced ALI remain undefined. In the present study, we investigated the oleic acid-induced changes in lung variables for the measure of ALI, inflammatory mediators, and neutrophil-derived substances. We evaluated the effects of pretreatment and posttreatment with propofol. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g. INTERVENTIONS: We employed a conscious and unrestrained rat model. Oleic acid at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered intravenously. Propofol (30 mg/kg) was given by intravenous infusion (6 mg/kg/min for 5 mins) 30 mins before (pretreatment) and 30 mins after (posttreatment) oleic acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We monitored the arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood gas. The lung weight changes, exhaled nitric oxide, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and Evans blue content in lung tissue were determined. The plasma nitrate/nitrite, methylguanidine, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10), neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase) were detected. Histopathological examination of the lung was performed. Oleic acid caused systemic hypotension and severe ALI as evidenced by the increases in the extent of ALI, impairment of pulmonary functions (blood gas variables), and lung pathology. In addition, oleic acid significantly increased inflammatory mediators and neutrophil-derived factors but depressed Na+-K+-ATPase. The inducible nitric oxide synthase was up-regulated. Pre- or posttreatment with propofol was capable of reversing the oleic acid-induced changes and attenuating the extent of ALI. CONCLUSIONS: Oleic acid resulted in sepsis-like responses including ALI, inflammatory reaction, and increased neutrophil-derived factors. It depressed the Na+-K+-ATPase activity but up-regulated inducible nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with propofol abrogated or reversed the oleic acid-induced changes.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless}0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the insidious onset of dyspnea or cough. However, a subset of patients has a short duration of symptoms with rapid progression to end-stage disease. In this study, we evaluated clinical and molecular features of "rapid" and "slow" progressors with IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: 26 patients with {\textless}6 months of symptoms before first presentation [rapid progressors] and 88 patients with {\textgreater}24 months of symptoms [slow progressors] were studied. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meyer method and proportional hazard's model. Lung microarrays and tissue proteins were measured in a subset of patients. No differences were found in age, physiologic impairment and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular profile. There were more males (OR = 6.5; CI:1.4-29.5; p = 0.006) and smokers (OR = 3.04; CI:1.1-8.3; p = 0.04) in the rapid progressors group. Survival from the beginning of symptoms was significantly reduced in rapid progressors (HR = 9.0; CI:4.48-18.3; p{\textless}0.0001) and there was a tendency for decreased survival from the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.5; CI:0.81-2.87; p = 0.18). We identified 437 differentially expressed genes. Lungs of rapid progressors overexpressed genes involved in morphogenesis, oxidative stress, migration/proliferation, and genes from fibroblasts/smooth muscle cells. Upregulation of two of these genes, adenosine-2B receptor and prominin-1/CD133, was validated by immunohistochemistry and were expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. BAL from rapid progressors showed a {\textgreater}2-fold increase of active matrix metalloproteinase-9, and induced a higher fibroblast migration compared with slow progressors and controls [238+/-98{\%} versus 123+/-29{\%} (p{\textless}0.05) and 30+/-17{\%} (p{\textless}0.01)].$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A subgroup of IPF patients, predominantly smoking males, display an accelerated clinical course and have a gene expression pattern that is different from those with slower progression and longer survival. These findings highlight the variability in the progression of IPF, and may explain, in part, the difficulty in obtaining significant and reproducible results in studies of therapeutic interventions in patients with IPF.},

abstract = {Introduction Accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has important therapeutic and prognostic implications and would be greatly aided by reliable diagnostic biomarkers as IPF has sometimes overlapping features with other interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Objectives To explore the value of serum metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 7 levels in the differential diagnosis of IPF with other ILD. Methods MMP-1/7 serum levels were measured using Luminex xMAP technology in 139 patients- 47 IPF, 36 non-IPF Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), 14 idiopathic Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (iNSIP), 29 secondary NSIP (secNSIP), 13 stage IV sarcoidosis- and 20 healthy controls, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results MMP-1 was significantly higher in IPF than non-IPF UIP (P =.042) and sarcoidosis (P =.027). MMP-7 was significantly higher in IPF than controls (P {\textless}.001), non-IPF UIP (P =.003), secNSIP (P {\textless}.001), and sarcoidosis (P {\textless}.001). The Area Under the Curve for IPF versus other ILD was 0.63 (95{\%}CI, 0.53-0.73) for MMP-1, 0.73 (95{\%}CI, 0.65-0.81) for MMP-7, and 0.74 (95{\%}CI, 0.66-0.82) for MMP-1/MMP-7 combined. Sensitivity and specificity for MMP-7 cutoff = 3.91 ng/mL was 72.3{\%} and 66.3{\%}, respectively, Positive Predictive Values = 52.3{\%} and Negative Predictive Values = 82.4{\%}. Conclusions MMP-1 and particularly MMP-7 serum levels were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF UIP, the main entity in differential diagnosis. The value of these biomarkers as additional tools in a multidisciplinary approach to IPF diagnosis needs to be considered and further explored.},

The OA complex of the IgG prepared by the heat-treatment procedure comprised of protein monomers and oligomers with bound OA. The IgG in the complexes retained most secondary but only partial tertiary structure and complex formation with OA did not abolish the ability of anti-erythrocyte IgG to bind to the erythrocytes. Anti-erythrocyte IgG-OA complexes were remarkably more hemolytic than those prepared using non-specific IgG, while complexes prepared using affinity purified anti-erythrocyte IgG were most effective in hemolyzing the cells. The work suggests that antibodies that exhibit affinity towards target cells may be useful in the preparation of selective and highly toxic OA complexes for the cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater}25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The analysis of lung artefacts has gained increasing importance as markers of lung pathology. B-line artefact (BLA), caused by a reverberation phenomenon, is the most important lung artefact. In this review, we discuss the current role of BLA in pneumology and explore open questions of the published consensus. METHODS We summarized current literature about BLA. Also, we presented observations on healthy subjects and patients with interstitial syndrome (pulmonary fibrosis and edema), to investigate technical factors influencing BLA visualization. RESULTS BLA imaging is influenced by more factors than recently assumed. When multiple BLA is visualized in the lung, they represent a sign of increased density due to the loss of aeration in the lung periphery. This condition may indicate different diseases including cardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse or focal interstitial lung diseases (ILD), infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Correct interpretation of BLA in lung ultrasound is strongly influenced by associated sonographic signs and careful integration of all relevant clinical information. CONCLUSIONS BLA is useful to monitor clinical response, and may become crucial in directing the diagnostic process. Further research is warranted to clarify technical adjustments, different probe and machine factors that influence the visualization of BLA.},

abstract = {Leptin is reported to be involved in acute lung injury (ALI). However, the role and underlying mechanisms of leptin in ALI remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether leptin deficiency promoted the development of ALI. LPS or oleic acid (OA) were administered to wild-type and leptin deficient (ob/ob) mice to induce ALI. Leptin level, survival rate, and lung injury were examined. Results showed that leptin levels were predominantly increased in the lung, but also in the heart, liver, kidney, and adipose tissue after LPS adminiatration. Compared with wild-type mice, LPS- or OA-induced lung injury was worse and the survival rate was lower in ob/ob mice. Moreover, leptin deficiency promoted the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Exogenous administration of leptin reduced lethality in ob/ob mice and ameliorated lung injury partly through inhibiting the activation of NF-{\$}\kappa{\$}B, p38, and ERK pathways. These results indicated that leptin deficiency contributed to the development of lung injury by enhancing inflammatory response, and a high level of leptin improved survival and protected against ALI.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous mold Aspergillus fumigatus threatens immunosuppressed patients as inducer of lethal invasive aspergillosis. A. fumigatus conidia are airborne and reach the alveoli, where they encounter alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Previous studies reported the importance of the surfactant-producing AEC II during A. fumigatus infection via in vitro experiments using cell lines. We established a negative isolation protocol yielding untouched primary murine AEC II with a purity {\textgreater}90{\%}, allowing ex vivo analyses of the cells, which encountered the mold in vivo. By label-free proteome analysis of AEC II isolated from mice 24h after A. fumigatus or mock infection we quantified 2256 proteins and found 154 proteins to be significantly differentially abundant between both groups (ANOVA p value 0.01, ratio of means {\textgreater}1.5 or 0.67, quantified with {\textgreater}2 peptides). Most of these proteins were higher abundant in the infected condition and reflected a comprehensive activation of AEC II on interaction with A. fumigatus. This was especially represented by proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, hence energy production. However, the most strongly induced protein was the L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) Interleukin 4 induced 1 (IL4I1) with a 42.9 fold higher abundance (ANOVA p value 2.91-10). IL4I1 has previously been found in B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and rare neurons. Increased IL4I1 abundance in AEC II was confirmed by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistology. Furthermore, A. fumigatus infected lungs showed high levels of IL4I1 metabolic products. Importantly, higher IL4I1 abundance was also confirmed in lung tissue from human aspergilloma. Because LAAO are key enzymes for bactericidal product generation, AEC II might actively participate in pathogen defense. We provide insights into proteome changes of primary AEC II thereby opening new avenues to analyze the molecular changes of this central lung cell on infectious threats. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005834.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a heterogeneous macrophage response that when experimentally polarized toward alternative forms of activation (M2 macrophages) promotes tissue and functional recovery. There are limited pharmacological therapies that can drive this reparative inflammatory state. In the current study, we used in vitro systems to comprehensively defined markers of macrophages with known pathological (M1) and reparative (M2) properties in SCI. We then used these markers to objectively define the macrophage activation states after SCI in response to delayed azithromycin treatment. Mice were subjected to moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI. Azithromycin or vehicle was administered beginning 30 minutes post-SCI and then daily for 3 or 7 days post injury (dpi). We detected a dose-dependent polarization toward purportedly protective M2 macrophages with daily AZM treatment. Specifically, AZM doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg decreased M1 macrophage gene expression at 3 dpi while the lowest (10 mg/kg) and highest (160 mg/kg) doses increased M2 macrophage gene expression at 7 dpi. Azithromycin has documented immunomodulatory properties and is commonly prescribed to treat infections in SCI individuals. This work demonstrates the utility of objective, comprehensive macrophage gene profiling for evaluating immunomodulatory SCI therapies and highlights azithromycin as a promising agent for SCI treatment. Spinal cord injury (SCI) activates CNS macrophages consisting of endogenous microglia and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells have pathological properties and contribute to neurodegeneration and tissue loss subsequent to the initial mechanical trauma. Activated macrophages also have the potential to promote tissue remodeling and axon regeneration 1–3 and there is growing evidence that transgenic, viral, or transplantation-mediated alterations in macrophage phenotype in SCI can be therapeutic 4 . The development of clinically viable, pharmacological interventions that harness the reparative potential of macrophages responding to SCI, however, remains a challenge facing the SCI community. To date, only one pharmacological agent, meth-ylprednisolone, is approved to treat SCI and its use is controversial. Increasingly, well-tolerated, pharmacological agents with immunomodulatory properties are being sought as therapies for SCI. Azithromycin (AZM) is a semisynthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin with significant immunomodulatory actions independent of is antibacterial properties 5,6},

abstract = {The absolute abundance of bacterial taxa in human host-associated environments play a critical role in reproductive and gastrointestinal health. However, obtaining the absolute abundance of many bacterial species is typically prohibitively expensive. In contrast, relative abundance data for many species is comparatively cheap and easy to collect (e.g., with universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene). In this paper, we propose a method to jointly model relative abundance data for many taxa and absolute abundance data for a subset of taxa. Our method provides point and interval estimates for the absolute abundance of all taxa. Crucially, our proposal accounts for differences in the efficiency of taxon detection in the relative and absolute abundance data. We show that modeling taxon-specific efficiencies substantially reduces the estimation error for absolute abundance, and controls the coverage of interval estimators. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method via a simulation study, a sensitivity study where we jackknife the taxa with observed absolute abundances, and a study of women with bacterial vaginosis.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in single-cell genomic, transcriptional, and mass-cytometric profiling, it remains a challenge to collect highly multiplexed measurements of secreted proteins from single cells for comprehensive analysis of functional states. Herein, we combine spatial and spectral encoding with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchambers for codetection of 42 immune effector proteins secreted from single cells, representing the highest multiplexing recorded to date for a single-cell secretion assay. Using this platform to profile differentiated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), reveals previously unobserved deep functional heterogeneity and varying levels of pathogenic activation. Uniquely protein profiling on the same single cells before and after LPS stimulation identified a role for macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) to potentiate the activation of LPS-induced cytokine production. Advanced clustering analysis identified functional subsets including quiescent, polyfunctional fully activated, partially activated populations with different cytokine profiles. This population architecture is conserved throughout the cell activation process and prevails as it is extended to other TLR ligands and to primary macrophages derived from a healthy donor. This work demonstrates that the phenotypically similar cell population still exhibits a large degree of intrinsic heterogeneity at the functional and cell behavior level. This technology enables full-spectrum dissection of immune functional states in response to pathogenic or environmental stimulation, and opens opportunities to quantify deep functional heterogeneity for more comprehensive and accurate immune monitoring.},

abstract = {In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the quantitation of disease severity using pulmonary function tests is often confounded by emphysema. We have identified the composite physiologic index (CPI) most closely reflecting the morphologic extent of pulmonary fibrosis. Consecutive patients with a clinical/computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 212) were divided into group I (n = 106) and group II (n = 106). The CPI was derived in group I (by fitting pulmonary function tests against disease extent on CT) and was tested in Group II. The formula for the CPI was as follows: extent of disease on CT = 91.0 - (0.65 x percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) - (0.53 x percent predicted FVC) + (0.34 x percent predicted FEV1). In group II, the CPI correlated more strongly with disease extent on CT (r2 = 0.51) than the individual pulmonary function test (DLCO the highest value, r2 = 0.38). A subanalysis demonstrated that the better fit of the CPI was ascribable to a correction of the confounding effects of emphysema. Mortality was predicted more accurately by the CPI than by a pulmonary function test in all clinical subgroups, including a separate cohort of 36 patients with histologically proven usual interstitial pneumonia (CPI, p {\textless} 0.0005; FVC, p = 0.002; PO2, p = 0.002). In conclusion, a new CPI, derived against CT and validated using split sample testing, is a more accurate prognostic determinant in usual interstitial pneumonia than an individual pulmonary function test.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Th e outcomes of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) who undergo hospitalization have not been well characterized. We sought to determine the frequency of all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations and to evaluate their impact on the subsequent course and survival of patients with IPF. METHODS: The records of patients with IPF evaluated at a tertiary center were examined for the cause and duration of hospitalization. Data on subsequent patient outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Th e IPF cohort consisted of 592 patients, 25.3{\%} of whom were hospitalized subse-quent to their IPF diagnosis. A respiratory-related cause accounted for 77.3{\%} of these hospi-talizations. Th e median transplant-free survival for all patients was 23.3 months (interquartile range [IQR], 7.6-63.6 months) from the time of consultation. Transplant-free survival aft er hospital admission was much lower for patients with a respiratory hospitalization com-pared with those with a nonrespiratory hospitalization (median survival, 2.8 months [IQR, 0.63-16.2 months] vs 27.7 months [IQR, 7.4-59.6 months]; P 5 .0004). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that both all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations were strongly asso-ciated with mortality aft er adjusting for baseline demographics. Among patients with a respi-ratory hospitalization, 22.4{\%} died while in the hospital, whereas 16.4{\%} eventually went on to lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations are common events in patients with IPF. Most hospitaliza-tions are respiratory-related and are associated with high in-hospital mortality and limited survival beyond discharge. Both all-cause and respiratory hospitalizations are associated with mortality, and therefore, either could be used as an end point in IPF clinical trials.},

Patients were randomised to carlumab (1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1, 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1, or 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of percentage change in forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary endpoints were time to disease progression, absolute change in FVC, relative change in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score.Due to a pre-planned, unfavourable interim benefit–risk analysis, dosing was suspended. The rate of percentage change in FVC showed no treatment effect (placebo −0.582{\%}, 1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −0.533{\%}, 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −0.799{\%} and 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −0.470{\%}; p=0.261). All active treatment groups showed a greater decline in FVC (1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −290 mL, 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −370 mL and 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −320 mL) compared with placebo (−130 mL). No effect on disease progression, DLCO, infection rates or mortality was observed. SGRQ scores showed a nonsignificant trend toward worsening with active treatment. Unexpectedly, free CC-chemokine ligand 2 levels were elevated above baseline at both 24 and 52 weeks. A higher proportion of patients with one or more serious adverse events was observed in the 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 group (53.1{\%}) compared with 1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 (15.2{\%}), 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 (21.9{\%}) and placebo (46.4{\%}), although no unexpected serious adverse events were noted.Although dosing was stopped prematurely, it is unlikely that carlumab provides benefit to IPF patients.It is unlikely that carlumab provides benefit to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis http://ow.ly/QUztq},

abstract = {Macrophages are either classically (M1) or alternatively-activated (M2). Whereas this nomenclature was generated from monocyte-derived macrophages treated in vitro with defined cytokine stimuli, the phenotype of in vivo-derived macrophages is less understood. We completed Affymetrix-based transcriptomic analysis of macrophages from the resolution phase of a zymosan-induced peritonitis. Compared with macrophages from hyperinflamed mice possessing a pro-inflammatory nature as well as naive macrophages from the uninflamed peritoneum, resolution-phase macrophages (rM) are similar to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), being CD209a positive but lacking CD11c. They are enriched for antigen processing/presentation (MHC class II [H2-Eb1, H2-Ab1, H2-Ob, H2-Aa], CD74, CD86), secrete T- and B-lymphocyte chemokines (Xcl1, Ccl5, Cxcl13) as well as factors that enhance macrophage/DC development, and promote DC/T cell synapse formation (Clec2i, Tnfsf4, Clcf1). rM are also enriched for cell cycle/proliferation genes as well as Alox15, Timd4, and Tgfb2, key systems in the termination of leukocyte trafficking and clearance of inflammatory cells. Finally, comparison with in vitro-derived M1/M2 shows that rM are neither classically nor alternatively activated but possess aspects of both definitions consistent with an immune regulatory phenotype. We propose that macrophages in situ cannot be rigidly categorized as they can express many shades of the inflammatory spectrum determined by tissue, stimulus, and phase of inflammation.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal, chronic, progressive disease characterized by formation of scar tissue within the lungs. Because it is a disease of unknown etiology, it is difficult to diagnose, to predict disease course and to devise treatment strategies. Recent evidence suggests that activated macrophages play key roles in the pathology of IPF. Therefore, imaging probes that specifically recognize these pools of activated immune cells could provide valuable information about how these cells contribute to the pathobiology of the disease. Here we demonstrate that cysteine cathepsin-targeted imaging probes can be used to monitor the contribution of macrophages to fibrotic disease progression in the bleomycin-induced murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we show that the probes highlight regions of macrophage involvement in fibrosis in human biopsy tissues from IPF patients. Finally, we present first-in-human results demonstrating non-invasive imaging of active cathepsins in fibrotic lesions of patients with IPF. Together, our findings validate small molecule cysteine cathepsin probes for clinical PET imaging and suggest that they have the potential to be used to generate mechanistically-informative molecular information regarding cellular drivers of IPF disease severity and progression.},

The validity of each approach has been amply demonstrated. Here we provide a simultaneous comparison of results from one- and two-color labeling designs, using two independent RNA samples from the Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) project, tested on each of three different microarray platforms. The data were evaluated in terms of reproducibility, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy to determine if the two approaches provide comparable results. For each of the three microarray platforms tested, the results show good agreement with high correlation coefficients and high concordance of differentially expressed gene lists within each platform. Cumulatively, these comparisons indicate that data quality is essentially equivalent between the one- and two-color approaches and strongly suggest that this variable need not be a primary factor in decisions regarding experimental microarray design.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of lethal, chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Over the past decade, macrophage has been recognized to play a significant role in IPF pathogenesis. Depending on the local microenvironments, macrophages can be polarized to either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. In general, M1 macrophages are responsible for wound healing after alveolar epithelial injury, while M2 macrophages are designated to resolve wound healing processes or terminate inflammatory responses in the lung. IPF is a pathological consequence resulted from altered wound healing in response to persistent lung injury. In this review, we intend to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the process of macrophage polarization and its mediators in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our goal is to update the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of IPF, and by which, we expect to provide help for developing effective therapeutic strategies in clinical settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes reportedly play important roles in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic agent; however, its effects on fibrocytes have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pirfenidone inhibits fibrocyte pool size in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. METHODS: Bleomycin (100 mg/kg) was infused with osmotic pumps into C57BL/6 mice, and pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily for 2 wk. The lungs were removed, and single-cell suspensions were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to detect fibrocytes, which were defined as CD45 and collagen-I double-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the lung specimens to quantify fibrocytes. Chemokines in the lung digests were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of pirfenidone on alveolar macrophages was evaluated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In a therapeutic setting, pirfenidone administration was initiated 10 days after bleomycin treatment. For chemotaxis assay, lung fibrocytes were isolated with immunomagnetic selection (CD45-positive mesenchymal cells) after culture and allowed to migrate toward chemokines in the presence or absence of pirfenidone. Moreover, the effect of pirfenidone on the expression of chemokine receptors on fibrocytes was evaluated. RESULTS: Pirfenidone significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis as assessed with quantitative histology and collagen measurement. Fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mice lungs was attenuated from 26.5{\%} to 13.7{\%} by pirfenidone on FACS analysis. This outcome was also observed in a therapeutic setting. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrocytes were significantly decreased by pirfenidone administration compared with those in bleomycin-treated mice (P = 0.0097). Increased chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) and CCL12 production in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs was significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (P = 0.0003 and P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). Pirfenidone also attenuated macrophage counts stimulated by bleomycin in BAL fluid. Fibrocyte migration toward CCL2 and chemokine (CC motif) receptor-2 expression on fibrocytes was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone attenuated the fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs via attenuation of CCL2 and CCL12 production in vivo, and fibrocyte migration was inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. Fibrocyte inhibition is considered a mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of pirfenidone.},

Numerous antifibrotic strategies have been used in the clinic with limited success, raising the possibility that an effective therapeutic strategy in this disease must inhibit fibrosis and promote appropriate lung repair mechanisms. IL-13 represents an attractive target in IPF, but its disease association and mechanism of action remains unknown. In the present study, an overexpression of IL-13 and IL-13 pathway markers was associated with IPF, particularly a rapidly progressive form of this disease. Targeting IL-13 in a humanized experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis using tralokinumab (CAT354) was found to therapeutically block aberrant lung remodeling in this model. However, targeting IL-13 was also found to promote lung repair and to restore epithelial integrity. Thus, targeting IL-13 inhibits fibrotic processes and enhances repair processes in the lung.},

abstract = {Fibroblasts are the most common cell type of the connective tissues found throughout the body and the principal source of the extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristic of these tissues. They are also the central mediators of the pathological fibrotic accumulation of ECM and the cellular proliferation and differentiation that occurs in response to prolonged tissue injury and chronic inflammation. The transformation of the fibroblast cell lineage involves classical developmental signaling programs and includes a surprisingly diverse range of precursor cell types-most notably, myofibroblasts that are the apex of the fibrotic phenotype. Myofibroblasts display exaggerated ECM production; constitutively secrete and are hypersensitive to chemical signals such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; and are endowed with a contractile apparatus allowing them to manipulate the ECM fibers physically to close open wounds. In addition to ECM production, fibroblasts have multiple concomitant biological roles, such as in wound healing, inflammation, and angiogenesis, which are each interwoven with the process of fibrosis. We now recognize many common fibroblast-related features across various physiological and pathological protracted processes. Indeed, a new appreciation has emerged for the role of non-cancerous fibroblast interactions with tumors in cancer progression. Although the predominant current clinical treatments of fibrosis involve non-specific immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative drugs, a variety of potential therapies under investigation specifically target fibroblast biology.},

abstract = {T helper 1 responses are typically proinflammatory, while Th2 responses have been considered regulatory. Interestingly, Th2 responses characterize a number of pulmonary diseases, many of which terminate in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. We developed a mouse model using Schistosoma mansoni eggs and cytokine-deficient mice to induce highly polarized Th1- or Th2-type inflammation in the lung. In this study, we examined the pathology and cytokine profiles in Th1- and Th2-polarized environments and used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to decipher the genes responsible for these effects. We further elaborated on the results using IL-10- and IL-13-deficient mice because these cytokines are believed to be the central regulators of Th2-associated pathology. We found that the Th1-polarized mice developed small granulomas with less fibrosis while expressing genes characteristic of tissue damage. Th2-polarized mice, in contrast, formed large granulomas with massive collagen deposition and up-regulated genes associated-with wound healing, specifically, arginase, collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMP. In addition, several members of the chitinase-like family were up-regulated in the lung following egg challenge. We also developed a method of defining the net collagen deposition using the expression profiles of several collagen, MMP, and tissue inhibitors of MMP genes. We found that Th1-polarized mice did not elaborate collagens or MMPs and therefore did not have a significant capacity for repair in this model. Thus, Th1-mediated inflammation is characterized by tissue damage, while Th2 directs wound healing and fibrosis.},

Our study examined the hypothesis that there were distinct differences in protein expression profiles that were related to the phenotype. From among the 323+/-51 protein spots that may represent the most highly expressed proteins in BALf of these patients, 24 unique spots were isolated and proteins identified. In particular, 9 spots were present in BALf of PM/DM patients only; 12 spots were exclusive of Overlap patients and 3 spots of AS patients. From among the proteins identified, a few were classified as cytoskeletal proteins, others were involved in oxidative stress and a number of proteins were associated with general metabolic activity or immunological response and inflammation. This is the first study in which evidence is provided that a number of different proteins are expressed in different subsets of PM/DM and supports our contention that the proteomic approach would be beneficial in discovering molecules which could represent possible prognostic factors of these rare pathologies.},

Results from individual studies can be inconsistent, and comparing published data is further complicated by a lack of standard processing and analysis methods. Here we introduce the MicrobiomeHD database, which includes 28 published case–control gut microbiome studies spanning ten diseases. We perform a cross-disease meta-analysis of these studies using standardized methods. We find consistent patterns characterizing disease-associated microbiome changes. Some diseases are associated with over 50 genera, while most show only 10–15 genus-level changes. Some diseases are marked by the presence of potentially pathogenic microbes, whereas others are characterized by a depletion of health-associated bacteria. Furthermore, we show that about half of genera associated with individual studies are bacteria that respond to more than one disease. Thus, many associations found in case–control studies are likely not disease-specific but rather part of a non-specific, shared response to health and disease.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Background The mechanism of TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2/TH17-low asthma is unknown. Objective We sought to study the immune mechanism of TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2/TH17-low asthma. Methods In a previously reported cohort of 60 asthmatic patients, 16 patients were immunophenotyped with TH2/TH17-predominant asthma and 22 patients with TH2/TH17-low asthma. We examined bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid leukocytes, cytokines, mediators, and epithelial cell function for these asthma subgroups. Results Patients with TH2/TH17-predominant asthma had increased IL-1{\$}\beta{\$}, IL-6, IL-23, C3a, and serum amyloid A levels in BAL fluid, and these correlated with IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} and C3a levels. TH2/TH17 cells expressed higher levels of the IL-1 receptor and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, inhibited BAL TH2/TH17 cell counts. TH2/TH17-low asthma had 2 distinct subgroups: neutrophilic asthma (45{\%}) and pauci-inflammatory asthma (55{\%}). This contrasted with patients with TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2-predominant asthma, which included neutrophilic asthma in 6{\%} and 0{\%} of patients, respectively. BAL fluid neutrophils strongly correlated with BAL fluid myeloperoxidase, IL-8, IL-1{\$}\alpha{\$}, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. Sixty percent of the patients with neutrophilic asthma had a pathogenic microorganism in BAL culture, which suggested a subclinical infection. Conclusion We uncovered a critical role for the IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} pathway in patients with TH2/TH17-predminant asthma. A subgroup of patients with TH2/TH17-low asthma had neutrophilic asthma and increased BAL fluid IL-1{\$}\alpha{\$}, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. IL-1{\$}\alpha{\$} was directly involved in IL-8 production and likely contributed to neutrophilic asthma. Sixty percent of neutrophilic patients had a subclinical infection.},

Interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is expressed in the epidermis from patients with SSc. However, information describing the role of IL-21 in SSc is limited. METHODS We established a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) IL-21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells in peripheral blood, skin and lungs of BLM-induced mice were detected by flow cytometry; IL-21 levels in the peripheral blood were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The frequency of Th17 cells was detected by flow cytometry; levels of IL-17 were evaluated by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors gamma t (ROR{\$}\backslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}t) messenger RNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Compared to control mice, the frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were significantly increased in BLM-induced mice. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were correlated with dermal and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analyses indicate that IL-21 promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells from CD4(+) cells isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced mice. CONCLUSION IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSc as a Th17 effector cytokine, and IL-21 may induce the differentiation of Th17 cells in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model.},

abstract = {The lung hosts multiple populations of macrophages and dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in lung pathology. The accurate identification and enumeration of these subsets are essential for understanding their role in lung pathology. Flow cytometry is a mainstream tool for studying the immune system. However, a systematic flow cytometric approach to identify subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) accurately and consistently in the normal mouse lung has not been described. Here we developed a panel of surface markers and an analysis strategy that accurately identify all known populations of macrophages and DCs, and their precursors in the lung during steady-state conditions and bleomycin-induced injury. Using this panel, we assessed the polarization of lung macrophages during the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Alveolar macrophages expressed markers of alternatively activated macrophages during both acute and fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury, whereas markers of classically activated macrophages were expressed only during the acute phase. Taken together, these data suggest that this flow cytometric panel is very helpful in identifying macrophage and DC populations and their state of activation in normal, injured, and fibrotic lungs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The analysis of lung artefacts has gained increasing importance as markers of lung pathology. B-line artefact (BLA), caused by a reverberation phenomenon, is the most important lung artefact. In this review, we discuss the current role of BLA in pneumology and explore open questions of the published consensus. METHODS We summarized current literature about BLA. Also, we presented observations on healthy subjects and patients with interstitial syndrome (pulmonary fibrosis and edema), to investigate technical factors influencing BLA visualization. RESULTS BLA imaging is influenced by more factors than recently assumed. When multiple BLA is visualized in the lung, they represent a sign of increased density due to the loss of aeration in the lung periphery. This condition may indicate different diseases including cardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse or focal interstitial lung diseases (ILD), infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Correct interpretation of BLA in lung ultrasound is strongly influenced by associated sonographic signs and careful integration of all relevant clinical information. CONCLUSIONS BLA is useful to monitor clinical response, and may become crucial in directing the diagnostic process. Further research is warranted to clarify technical adjustments, different probe and machine factors that influence the visualization of BLA.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages are a heterogeneous population of mononuclear phagocytes that are involved in antigen processing and presentation to initiate and regulate immune responses to pathogens, vaccines, tumor, and tolerance to self. In addition to their afferent sentinel function, DCs and macrophages are also critical as effectors and coordinators of inflammation and homeostasis in peripheral tissues. Harnessing DCs and macrophages for therapeutic purposes has major implications for infectious disease, vaccination, transplantation, tolerance induction, inflammation, and cancer immunotherapy. There has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of the developmental origin and function of the cellular constituents of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Significant progress has been made in tandem in both human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte biology. This progress has been accelerated by comparative biology analysis between mouse and human, which has proved to be an exceptionally fruitful strategy to harmonize findings across species. Such analyses have provided unexpected insights and facilitated productive reciprocal and iterative processes to inform our understanding of human and mouse mononuclear phagocytes. In this review, we discuss the strategies, power, and utility of comparative biology approaches to integrate recent advances in human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte biology and its potential to drive forward clinical translation of this knowledge. We also present a functional framework on the parallel organization of human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte networks.},

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

abstract = {Motivation: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in
genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined
by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways.
There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are
typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which
do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of
transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple
molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing.
Results: We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on
functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based
on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects
of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net
regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is
performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on
weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both
simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on
human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly
better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more
pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than
the competing approaches.},

Recent studies suggest that the invasion success of many species might depend more heavily on their ability to respond to natural selection than on broad physiological tolerance or plasticity. Thus, these studies stress the importance of genetic architecture, selection upon which could result in evolutionary adaptations and possibly speciation. For instance, epistatic interactions and the action of a few genes could facilitate invasion success. These findings emphasize the utility of genomic approaches for determining invasion mechanisms, through analysis of gene expression, gene interactions, and genomic rearrangements that are associated with invasion events.},

abstract = {Disease conditions associated with pulmonary fibrosis are progressive and have a poor long-term prognosis with irreversible changes in airway architecture leading to marked morbidity and mortalities. Using murine models we demonstrate a role for interleukin (IL)-25 in the generation of pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, we identify IL-13 release from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) as sufficient to drive collagen deposition in the lungs of challenged mice and suggest this as a potential mechanism through which IL-25 is acting. Additionally, we demonstrate that in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis there is increased pulmonary expression of IL-25 and also observe a population ILC2 in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Collectively, we present an innate mechanism for the generation of pulmonary fibrosis, via IL-25 and ILC2, that occurs independently of T-cell-mediated antigen-specific immune responses. These results suggest the potential of therapeutically targeting IL-25 and ILC2 for the treatment of human fibrotic diseases.},

abstract = {Here, we show that apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL), through both innate and adaptive immune processes, potently suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in multiple animal tumor models, including the aggressive B16F10L murine malignant melanoma model. Mice expressing the human apoA1 transgene (A1Tg) exhibited increased infiltration of CD11b(+) F4/80(+) macrophages with M1, anti-tumor phenotype, reduced tumor burden and metastasis, and enhanced survival. In contrast, apoA1-deficient (A1KO) mice showed markedly heightened tumor growth and reduced survival. Injection of human apoA1 into A1KO mice inoculated with tumor cells remarkably reduced both tumor growth and metastasis, enhanced survival, and promoted regression of both tumor and metastasis burden when administered following palpable tumor formation and metastasis development. Studies with apolipoprotein A2 revealed the anti-cancer therapeutic effect was specific to apoA1. In vitro studies ruled out substantial direct suppressive effects by apoA1 or HDL on tumor cells. Animal models defective in different aspects of immunity revealed both innate and adaptive arms of immunity contribute to complete apoA1 anti-tumor activity. This study reveals a potent immunomodulatory role for apoA1 in the tumor microenvironment, altering tumor-associated macrophages from a pro-tumor M2 to an anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Use of apoA1 to redirect in vivo elicited tumor-infiltrating macrophages toward tumor rejection may hold benefit as a potential cancer therapeutic.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, causes invasive disease in immunocompromised humans. Although monocytes and antigen-specific CD4 T cells contribute to defense against inhaled fungal spores, how these cells interact during infection remains undefined. Investigating the role of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells during fungal infection, we find that A. fumigatus infection induces an influx of chemokine receptor CCR2- and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes into lungs and draining lymph nodes. Depletion of CCR2+cells reduced A. fumigatus conidial transport from lungs to draining lymph nodes, abolished CD4 T cell priming following respiratory challenge, and impaired pulmonary fungal clearance. In contrast, depletion of CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes during systemic fungal infection did not prevent CD4 T cell priming in the spleen. Our findings demonstrate that pulmonary CD4 T cell responses to inhaled spores require CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes and their derivatives, revealing a compartmentally restricted function for these cells in adaptive respiratory immune responses. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Activation of the innate immune system plays a key role in exacerbations of chronic lung disease, yet the potential role of lung fibroblasts in innate immunity and the identity of epithelial danger signals (alarmins) that may contribute to this process are unclear. The objective of the study was to identify lung epithelial-derived alarmins released during endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and oxidative stress and evaluate their potential to induce innate immune responses in lung fibroblasts. We found that treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs) with conditioned media from damaged lung epithelial cells significantly upregulated interleukin IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression (P{\textless}0.05). This effect was reduced with anti-IL-1$\alpha$ or IL-1Ra but not anti-IL-1$\beta$ antibody. Costimulation with a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), significantly accentuated the IL-1$\alpha$-induced inflammatory phenotype in PHLFs, and this effect was blocked with inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta and TGF$\beta$-activated kinase-1 inhibitors. Finally, Il1r1-/- and Il1a-/- mice exhibit reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophilia and collagen deposition in response to bleomycin treatment. We conclude that IL-1$\alpha$ plays a pivotal role in triggering proinflammatory responses in fibroblasts and this process is accentuated in the presence of double-stranded RNA. This mechanism may be important in the repeated cycles of injury and exacerbation in chronic lung disease.},

A major goal of these studies is the identification of important groups of microorganisms that vary according to physiological or disease states in the host, but the incidence of rare taxa and the large numbers of taxa observed make that goal difficult to obtain using traditional approaches. Fortunately, similar problems have been addressed by the machine learning community in other fields of study such as microarray analysis and text classification. In this review, we demonstrate that several existing supervised classifiers can be applied effectively to microbiota classification, both for selecting subsets of taxa that are highly discriminative of the type of community, and for building models that can accurately classify unlabeled data. To encourage the development of new approaches to supervised classification of microbiota, we discuss several structures inherent in microbial community data that may be available for exploitation in novel approaches, and we include as supplemental information several benchmark classification tasks for use by the community.},

abstract = {Fibrosis or scarring of diverse organs and tissues is considered as a pathologic consequence of a chronically altered wound healing response which is tightly linked to inflammation and angiogenesis. The recruitment of immune cells, local proliferation of fibroblasts and the consecutive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins are common pathophysiological hallmarks of tissue fibrosis, irrespective of the organ involved. Chemokines, a family of chemotactic cytokines, appear to be central mediators of the initiation as well as progression of these biological processes. Traditionally chemokines have only been considered to play a critical role in orchestrating the influx of immune cells to sites of tissue injury. However, within the last years, further aspects of chemokine biology including fibroblast activation and angiogenesis have been deciphered in tissue fibrosis of many different organs. Interestingly, certain chemokines appear to mediate common effects in liver, kidney, lung, and skin of various animal models, while others mediate tissue specific effects. These aspects have to be kept in mind when extrapolating data of animal studies to early human trials. Nevertheless, the further understanding of chemokine effects in tissue fibrosis might be an attractive approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets in chronic organ damage associated with high morbidity and mortality.

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify genomic commonalities between the gene expression profiles from 100 IPF lungs and 108 control lungs that were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, and rat lungs harvested at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 after bleomycin instillation. Surprisingly, the highest gene expression similarity between bleomycin-treated rat and IPF lungs was observed at Day 7. At this point of maximal rat-human commonality, we identified a novel set of 12 disease-relevant translational gene markers (C6, CTHRC1, CTSE, FHL2, GAL, GREM1, LCN2, MMP7, NELL1, PCSK1, PLA2G2A, and SLC2A5) that was able to separate almost all patients with IPF from control subjects in our cohort and in two additional IPF/control cohorts (GSE10667 and GSE24206). Furthermore, in combination with diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide measurements, four members of the translational gene marker set contributed to stratify patients with IPF according to disease severity. Significantly, pirfenidone attenuated the expression change of one (CTHRC1) translational gene marker in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, in transforming growth factor-{\$}\beta{\$}1-treated primary human lung fibroblasts and transforming growth factor-{\$}\beta{\$}1-treated human epithelial A549 cells.

A novel systematic approach MMMG (Methylation-MicroRNA-MRNA-GO) was proposed to identify potential COPD genes by integrating function information with a methylation profile, a microRNA expression profile and an mRNA expression profile. 8 co-functional classes and 102 potential COPD genes were identified. These genes displayed a high performance in classifying COPD patients and normal samples, revealed COPD-related pathways, and have been confirmed to be associated with COPD by Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)-values, literature, an independent data set, and pathways. The MMMG method that analyzed multi-omics data at the functional level could effectively identify potential COPD genes. These potential COPD genes would provide in-depth insights into understanding the complexity of COPD genome landscapes, improve the early diagnostics, and guide new efforts to develop therapeutics in the future.},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 3.77 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 and 94.3{\%} accuracy. Cut-off values of 4.66 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 2.52 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 possessed 99.4 and 93.2{\%} accuracy for differentiating among the IPF and other interstitial lung disease groups. Conclusions: Innate immune responses may be associated with the development of IPF. Furthermore, the IL-33 and TSLP levels in BAL fluids may be useful for differentiating IPF from other chronic interstitial lung diseases.},

abstract = {SignificanceListeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen responsible for listeriosis, a foodborne disease characterized by septicemia and abortion in pregnant women. The most severe listeriosis outbreaks are associated with a subset of bacterial epidemic clones, although the underlying virulence mechanisms of these clones remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that these epidemic strains secrete a bacteriocin specifically in the gut and alter host intestinal microbiota, allowing L. monocytogenes colonization of the intestine and, consequently, invasion of deeper organs. Therefore, our work shows that epidemic listeriosis implicates not only interactions between L. monocytogenes and host cells, but also interactions between L. monocytogenes and the host intestinal microbiota that are critical for the establishment of infection. Listeria monocytogenes is responsible for gastroenteritis in healthy individuals and for a severe invasive disease in immunocompromised patients. Among the three identified L. monocytogenes evolutionary lineages, lineage I strains are overrepresented in epidemic listeriosis outbreaks, but the mechanisms underlying the higher virulence potential of strains of this lineage remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Listeriolysin S (LLS), a virulence factor only present in a subset of lineage I strains, is a bacteriocin highly expressed in the intestine of orally infected mice that alters the host intestinal microbiota and promotes intestinal colonization by L. monocytogenes, as well as deeper organ infection. To our knowledge, these results therefore identify LLS as the first bacteriocin described in L. monocytogenes and associate modulation of host microbiota by L. monocytogenes epidemic strains to increased virulence.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal, chronic, progressive disease characterized by formation of scar tissue within the lungs. Because it is a disease of unknown etiology, it is difficult to diagnose, to predict disease course and to devise treatment strategies. Recent evidence suggests that activated macrophages play key roles in the pathology of IPF. Therefore, imaging probes that specifically recognize these pools of activated immune cells could provide valuable information about how these cells contribute to the pathobiology of the disease. Here we demonstrate that cysteine cathepsin-targeted imaging probes can be used to monitor the contribution of macrophages to fibrotic disease progression in the bleomycin-induced murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we show that the probes highlight regions of macrophage involvement in fibrosis in human biopsy tissues from IPF patients. Finally, we present first-in-human results demonstrating non-invasive imaging of active cathepsins in fibrotic lesions of patients with IPF. Together, our findings validate small molecule cysteine cathepsin probes for clinical PET imaging and suggest that they have the potential to be used to generate mechanistically-informative molecular information regarding cellular drivers of IPF disease severity and progression.},

abstract = {Although macrophages are widely recognized to have a profibrotic role in inflammation, we have used a highly tractable CCl(4)-induced model of reversible hepatic fibrosis to identify and characterize the macrophage phenotype responsible for tissue remodeling: the hitherto elusive restorative macrophage. This CD11B(hi) F4/80(int) Ly-6C(lo) macrophage subset was most abundant in livers during maximal fibrosis resolution and represented the principle matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -expressing subset. Depletion of this population in CD11B promoter-diphtheria toxin receptor (CD11B-DTR) transgenic mice caused a failure of scar remodeling. Adoptive transfer and in situ labeling experiments showed that these restorative macrophages derive from recruited Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, a common origin with profibrotic Ly-6C(hi) macrophages, indicative of a phenotypic switch in vivo conferring proresolution properties. Microarray profiling of the Ly-6C(lo) subset, compared with Ly-6C(hi) macrophages, showed a phenotype outside the M1/M2 classification, with increased expression of MMPs, growth factors, and phagocytosis-related genes, including Mmp9, Mmp12, insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), and Glycoprotein (transmembrane) nmb (Gpnmb). Confocal microscopy confirmed the postphagocytic nature of restorative macrophages. Furthermore, the restorative macrophage phenotype was recapitulated in vitro by the phagocytosis of cellular debris with associated activation of the ERK signaling cascade. Critically, induced phagocytic behavior in vivo, through administration of liposomes, increased restorative macrophage number and accelerated fibrosis resolution, offering a therapeutic strategy to this orphan pathological process.},

abstract = {Fibrogenesis involves a pathological accumulation of activated fibroblasts and extensive matrix remodeling. Profibrotic cytokines, such as TGF-$\beta$, stimulate fibroblasts to overexpress fibrotic matrix proteins and induce further expression of profibrotic cytokines, resulting in progressive fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a profibrotic cytokine that is indicative of fibroblast activation. Epithelial cells are abundant in the normal lung, but their contribution to fibrogenesis remains poorly defined. Profibrotic cytokines may activate epithelial cells with protein expression and functions that overlap with the functions of active fibroblasts. We found that alveolar epithelial cells undergoing TGF-$\beta$-mediated mesenchymal transition in vitro were also capable of activating lung fibroblasts through production of CTGF. Alveolar epithelial cell expression of CTGF was dramatically reduced by inhibition of Rho signaling. CTGF reporter mice demonstrated increased CTGF promoter activity by lung epithelial cells acutely after bleomycin in vivo. Furthermore, mice with lung epithelial cell-specific deletion of CTGF had an attenuated fibrotic response to bleomycin. These studies provide direct evidence that epithelial cell activation initiates a cycle of fibrogenic effector cell activation during progressive fibrosis. Therapy targeted at epithelial cell production of CTGF offers a novel pathway for abrogating this progressive cycle and limiting tissue fibrosis.},

Here we investigate the roles of the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) and the common adaptor for Toll/IL-1R signal transduction, MyD88, in this process using a murine model of acute pulmonary injury. Bleomycin insult results in expression of neutrophil and lymphocyte chemotactic factors, chronic inflammation, remodeling, and fibrosis. We demonstrate that these end points were attenuated in the lungs of IL-1R1– and MyD88-defi- cient mice. Further, in bone marrow chimera experiments, bleomycin-induced inflammation required pri- marily MyD88 signaling from radioresistant resident cells. Exogenous rIL-1$\beta$ recapitulated a high degree of bleomycin-induced lung pathology, and specific blockade of IL-1R1 by IL-1 receptor antagonist dramatically reduced bleomycin-induced inflammation. Finally, we found that lung IL-1$\beta$ production and inflammation in response to bleomycin required ASC, an inflammasome adaptor molecule. In conclusion, bleomycin-induced lung pathology required the inflammasome and IL-1R1/MyD88 signaling, and IL-1 represented a critical effec- tor of pathology and therapeutic target of chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Alternative activation of alveolar macrophages is linked to fibrosis following exposure to asbestos. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic M2 phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 ({\textgreater}3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-{\$}\beta{\$}1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Arg(432) and Arg(434) in domain V of MARCO are required for the polarization of macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype as mutation of these residues reduced FIZZ1 expression (17-fold) compared with cells expressing MARCO. These observations demonstrate that a macrophage membrane protein regulates the fibrotic response to lung injury and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention.-Murthy, S., Larson-Casey, J.

Evidence from murine and human studies has suggested that monocytosis can be an indicator of various inflammatory diseases. Monocytes can differentiate into inflammatory or anti-inflammatory subsets. Upon tissue damage or infection, monocytes are rapidly recruited to the tissue, where they can differentiate into tissue macrophages or dendritic cells. Given the rapid progress in monocyte research from broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases, there is a need to summarize our knowledge in monocyte heterogeneity and its impact in human disease. In this review, we describe the current understanding of heterogeneity of human and murine monocytes, the function of distinct subsets of monocytes, and a potential mechanism for monocyte differentiation.

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

Fibrotic tissue remodeling can also influence cancer metastasis and accelerate chronic graft rejection in transplant recipients. Nevertheless, despite its enormous impact on human health, there are currently no approved treatments that directly target the mechanism(s) of fibrosis. The primary goals of this Review series on fibrotic diseases are to discuss some of the major fibroproliferative diseases and to identify the common and unique mechanisms of fibrogenesis that might be exploited in the development of effective antifibrotic therapies.},

abstract = {Classically (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions. It has been difficult to dissect macrophage phenotypes in vivo, where a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes exists, and also in vitro, where low or non-selective M2 marker protein expression is observed. To provide a foundation for the complexity of in vivo macrophage phenotypes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional signature of murine M0, M1 and M2 macrophages and identified genes common or exclusive to either subset. We validated by real-time PCR an M1-exclusive pattern of expression for CD38, G-protein coupled receptor 18 (Gpr18) and Formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) whereas Early growth response protein 2 (Egr2) and c-Myc were M2-exclusive. We further confirmed these data by flow cytometry and show that M1 and M2 macrophages can be distinguished by their relative expression of CD38 and Egr2. Egr2 labeled more M2 macrophages ({\~{}}70{\%}) than the canonical M2 macrophage marker Arginase-1, which labels 24{\%} of M2 macrophages. Conversely, CD38 labeled most (71{\%}) in vitro M1 macrophages. In vivo, a similar CD38+ population greatly increased after LPS exposure. Overall, this work defines exclusive and common M1 and M2 signatures and provides novel and improved tools to distinguish M1 and M2 murine macrophages.},

Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or differentiated in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic polarization conditions. Computational analysis relates a spectrum of cellular states in vivo to in-vitro-differentiated Th17 cells and unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four new genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso, and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while potentially sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.},

abstract = {Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains a major cause of morbidity in immunocompromised hosts. This is due to the inability of the host immunity to respond appropriately to Aspergillus. An established risk factor for IA is neutropenia which is encountered by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Herein we investigate the role of neutrophils in modulating host response to Aspergillus. We found that neutrophils had the propensity to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production but through different mechanisms for specific cytokines. Cellular contact was requisite for the modulation of interleukin-1 beta production by Aspergillus with the involvement of complement receptor 3. On the other hand, inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production (TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$}) was cell contact-independent and mediated by secreted myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specifically, the inhibition of TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} by MPO was through the TLR4 pathway and involved interference with the mRNA transcription of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) / interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). Our study illustrates the extended immune modulatory role of neutrophils beyond its primary phagocytic function. The absence of neutrophils and loss of its inhibitory effect on cytokine production explains the hypercytokinemia seen in neutropenic patients when infected with Aspergillus.},

In this paper, we compare the performance of different competing methods to model data with zero inflated features through extensive simulations and application to a microbiome study. These methods include standard parametric and non-parametric models, hurdle models, and zero inflated models. We examine varying degrees of zero inflation, with or without dispersion in the count component, as well as different magnitude and direction of the covariate effect on structural zeros and the count components. We focus on the assessment of type I error, power to detect the overall covariate effect, measures of model fit, and bias and effectiveness of parameter estimations. We also evaluate the abilities of model selection strategies using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Vuong test to identify the correct model. The simulation studies show that hurdle and zero inflated models have well controlled type I errors, higher power, better goodness of fit measures, and are more accurate and efficient in the parameter estimation. Besides that, the hurdle models have similar goodness of fit and parameter estimation for the count component as their corresponding zero inflated models. However, the estimation and interpretation of the parameters for the zero components differs, and hurdle models are more stable when structural zeros are absent. We then discuss the model selection strategy for zero inflated data and implement it in a gut microbiome study of {\textgreater}400 independent subjects.},

abstract = {In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the quantitation of disease severity using pulmonary function tests is often confounded by emphysema. We have identified the composite physiologic index (CPI) most closely reflecting the morphologic extent of pulmonary fibrosis. Consecutive patients with a clinical/computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 212) were divided into group I (n = 106) and group II (n = 106). The CPI was derived in group I (by fitting pulmonary function tests against disease extent on CT) and was tested in Group II. The formula for the CPI was as follows: extent of disease on CT = 91.0 - (0.65 x percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) - (0.53 x percent predicted FVC) + (0.34 x percent predicted FEV1). In group II, the CPI correlated more strongly with disease extent on CT (r2 = 0.51) than the individual pulmonary function test (DLCO the highest value, r2 = 0.38). A subanalysis demonstrated that the better fit of the CPI was ascribable to a correction of the confounding effects of emphysema. Mortality was predicted more accurately by the CPI than by a pulmonary function test in all clinical subgroups, including a separate cohort of 36 patients with histologically proven usual interstitial pneumonia (CPI, p {\textless}0.0005; FVC, p = 0.002; PO2, p = 0.002). In conclusion, a new CPI, derived against CT and validated using split sample testing, is a more accurate prognostic determinant in usual interstitial pneumonia than an individual pulmonary function test.},

abstract = {Motivation: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in
genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined
by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways.
There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are
typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which
do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of
transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple
molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing.
Results: We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on
functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based
on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects
of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net
regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is
performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on
weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both
simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on
human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly
better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more
pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than
the competing approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with aberrant expression of developmental pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh). As Hh signalling contributes to multiple pro-fibrotic processes, Hh inhibition may represent a therapeutic option for IPF. However, no non-invasive biomarkers are available to monitor lung Hh activity. METHODS We assessed gene and protein expression in IPF and control lung biopsies, mouse lung, fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with sonic hedgehog (SHh), and plasma in IPF patients versus controls, and cancer patients before and after treatment with vismodegib, a Hh inhibitor. RESULTS Lung tissue from IPF patients exhibited significantly greater expression of Hh-related genes versus controls. The gene most significantly upregulated in both IPF lung biopsies and fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with SHh was CXCL14, which encodes a soluble secreted chemokine whose expression is inhibited in vitro by the addition of vismodegib. CXCL14 expression was induced by SHh overexpression in mouse lung. Circulating CXCL14 protein levels were significantly higher in plasma from IPF patients than controls. In cancer patients, circulating CXCL14 levels were significantly reduced upon vismodegib treatment. CONCLUSIONS CXCL14 is a systemic biomarker that could be used to identify IPF patients with increased Hh pathway activity and monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of Hh antagonist therapy in IPF.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease defined by the presence of nonnecrotizing granuloma in the absence of any known cause. Although clinically, the heterogeneity of sarcoidosis is well characterized, the transcriptome of the sarcoidosis and underlying molecular mechanisms are not. The signal of all transcripts, small and long noncoding RNAs, can be detected using microarrays or RNA-Sequencing. Analyzing the transcriptome of tissues that are directly affected by granulomas is of great importance to understand biology of the disease and may be predictive of disease and treatment outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple genome wide expression studies performed on sarcoidosis affected tissues were published in the last 11 years. Published studies focused to examine differences in gene expression levels between sarcoidosis vs. control tissues, stable vs. progressive form of sarcoidosis, as well as sarcoidosis vs. other diseases. Strikingly, all these transcriptomics data confirm the key role of TH1 immune response in sarcoidosis and particularly of interferon-{\$}\backslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}(IFN-{\$}\backslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}) and type I IFN-driven signaling pathways. SUMMARY First steps toward transcriptomics of sarcoidosis in precision medicine are taken and highlight the potentials of this approach.

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is the pathologic basis for a variety of incurable human chronic lung diseases. IL-17A, a glycoprotein secreted from IL-17–producing cells, has recently been shown to be a proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammation and autoimmune disease. In this study, we report that IL-17A increased the synthesis and secretion of collagen and promoted the epithelial–mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells in a TGF-b1–dependent manner. Using in vivo fibrotic models, we found IL-17A expression to be elevated and IL-17A–associated signaling pathways to be activated in fibrotic lung tissues. Neutralization of IL-17A in vivo promoted the resolution of bleomycin-induced acute inflammation, attenuated pulmonary fibrosis, and increased survival. Additionally, IL-17A antagonism inhibited silica-induced chronic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting IL-17A resulted in a shift of the suppressive immune response in fibrotic lung tissue toward a Th1-type immune response, and it effectively induced autophagy, which promoted the autophagic degradation of collagen and autophagy-associated cell death. Moreover, IL-17A was found to attenuate the starvation-induced autophagy, and autophagy modulators regulated collagen degradation in the alveolar epithelial cells in a TGF-b1–independent manner. Administration of 3-methylamphetamine, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the therapeutic efficacy of IL-17A antagonism in pulmonary fibrosis. Our studies indicate that IL-17A participates in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both TGF-b1–dependent and –independent manners and that the components of the IL-17A signaling pathway are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of fibroproliferative lung diseases.},

abstract = {Macrophages are innate immune cells which can react to a large number of environmental stimuli thanks to a high degree of plasticity. These cells are involved in a variety of tissue functions in homeostasis, and they play essential roles in pathological contexts. Macrophages' activation state, which determines their functional orientation, is strongly influenced by the cellular environment. A large body of macrophage literature is devoted to better defining polarizations from a molecular viewpoint. It is now accepted that a multidimensional model of polarization is needed to grasp the broad phenotype repertoire controlled by environmental signals. The study presented here aimed, among other goals, to provide a molecular signature of various polarizations in human macrophages at the protein level to better define the different macrophage activation states. To study the proteome in human monocyte-derived macrophages as a function of their polarization state, we used a label-free quantification approach on in-gel fractionated and LysC/Trypsin digested proteins. In total, 5102 proteins were identified and quantified for all polarization states. New polarization-specific markers were identified and validated. Because oxygen tension is an important environmental parameter in tissues, we explored how environmental oxygen tension, at either atmospheric composition (18.6{\%} O2) or "tissue normoxia" (3{\%} O2), affected our classification of macrophage polarization. The comparative results revealed new polarization-specific makers which suggest that environmental oxygen levels should be taken into account when characterizing macrophage activation states. The proteomic screen revealed various polarization-specific proteins and oxygen sensors in human macrophages. One example is arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), an IL4/IL13 polarization-specific protein, which was upregulated under low oxygen conditions and is associated with an increase in the rate of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. These results illustrate the need to consider physicochemical parameters like oxygen level when studying macrophage polarization, so as to correctly assess their functions in tissue.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of lethal, chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Over the past decade, macrophage has been recognized to play a significant role in IPF pathogenesis. Depending on the local microenvironments, macrophages can be polarized to either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. In general, M1 macrophages are responsible for wound healing after alveolar epithelial injury, while M2 macrophages are designated to resolve wound healing processes or terminate inflammatory responses in the lung. IPF is a pathological consequence resulted from altered wound healing in response to persistent lung injury. In this review, we intend to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the process of macrophage polarization and its mediators in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our goal is to update the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of IPF, and by which, we expect to provide help for developing effective therapeutic strategies in clinical settings.},

abstract = {RATIONALE The mechanism by which acute allograft rejection leads to chronic rejection remains poorly understood despite its common occurrence. Exosomes, membrane vesicles released from cells within the lung allograft, contain a diverse array of biomolecules that closely reflect the biologic state of the cell and tissue from which they are released. Exosome transcriptomes may provide a better understanding of the rejection process. Furthermore, biomarkers originating from this transcriptome could provide timely and sensitive detection of acute cellular rejection (AR), reducing the incidence of severe AR and chronic lung allograft dysfunction and improving outcomes. OBJECTIVES To provide an in-depth analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid exosomal shuttle RNA population after lung transplantation and evaluate for differential expression between acute AR and quiescence. METHODS Serial bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were ultracentrifuged to obtain the exosomal pellet for RNA extraction, on which RNA-Seq was performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS AR demonstrates an intense inflammatory environment, skewed toward both innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel, potential upstream regulators identified offer potential therapeutic targets.

abstract = {The heart and blood vessels of a healthy individual contain resident immune cells, the majority of which are macrophages that have seeded these organs early in the development. In the mouse, ≈10{\%} of noncardiomyocytes are macrophages,1,2 and humans may have comparable numbers.1 After myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the heart through the combined effects of massive recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells and local self-renewal.1,3 Likewise, in atherosclerosis, the chronic lipid–driven inflammatory disease that is the underlying cause of myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the vessel wall, again because of recruitment and local proliferation.4 Although many of these insights have been generated in mouse models, compelling evidence from genome-wide association studies have associated innate immunity mediators with myocardial infarction,5 whereas prospective human studies have shown that blood monocyte levels can predict cardiovascular events in patients.6 

During the past decade, multiple studies have challenged and, in some cases, dismantled old assumptions about macrophage origins and functions. Many reviews and opinion pieces7–19—some of them our own20–23—have been written on the subject because the various communities interested in macrophage biology seek to contextualize the findings into a coherent narrative. We now know that, in the steady state, arterial24 and cardiac1,25–27 macrophages are mostly independent of monocytes, but in response to an inflammatory trigger, such as myocardial infarction or high-fat diet, monocyte-derived cells accumulate and differentiate to self-renewing macrophages.3,4,28,29 We also know that macrophage function goes far beyond phagocytosis. Because they reside in nearly every organ, macrophages respond and adapt to their local surroundings, and their noncanonical activities reflect their flexibility.

Implementation of this model revealed that four prostate cancer gene expression datasets shared significantly similar results, independent of the method and technology used (i.e., spotted cDNA versus oligonucleotide). This interstudy cross-validation approach generated a cohort of genes that were consistently and significantly dysregulated in prostate cancer. Bioinformatic investigation of these genes revealed a synchronous network of transcriptional regulation in the polyamine and purine biosynthesis pathways. Beyond the specific implications for prostate cancer, this work establishes a much-needed model for the evaluation, cross-validation, and comparison of multiple cancer profiling studies.},

Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processesremain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages.

abstract = {T helper 9 (Th9) cells contribute to lung inflammation and allergy as sources of interleukin-9 (IL-9). However, the mechanisms by which IL-9/Th9 mediate immunopathology in the lung are unknown. Here we report an IL-9-driven positive feedback loop that reinforces allergic inflammation. We show that IL-9 increases IL-2 production by mast cells, which leads to expansion of CD25+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and subsequent activation of Th9 cells. Blocking IL-9 or inhibiting CD117 (c-Kit) signalling counteracts the pathogenic effect of the described IL-9-mast cell-IL-2 signalling axis. Overproduction of IL-9 is observed in expectorates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and a sex-specific variant of IL-9 is predictive of allergic reactions in female patients. Our results suggest that blocking IL-9 may be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate inflammation associated with microbial colonization in the lung, and offers a plausible explanation for gender differences in clinical outcomes of patients with CF.},

abstract = {Problems related to the safety and efficacy of gene therapies have checked the enthusiasm once surrounding this field, though it remains a promising approach for the treatment of numerous diseases. Despite the high transfection efficiencies attainable using viral vectors, manufacturing difficulties, safety concerns, and limitations related to targeting and plasmid size have prompted considerable research into the development of non-viral vectors. Non-viral vectors demonstrate low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and ease of manufacture. However, they have not yet achieved the transfection efficiencies displayed by viruses. The inability to explain or predict transfection efficiencies results, in part, from insufficient understanding of the intracellular processes involved in gene delivery. Increasingly, research has been undertaken to probe the processes involved in overcoming the major obstacles to vector-mediated transfection: (1) internalization, (2) intracellular trafficking, (3) escape to the cytosol, (4) nuclear translocation, and (5) gene transcription/expression. This paper reviews and compares the pathways and techniques involved in successful viral and non-viral transfection. In addition, this review provides evidence that non-viral vector development has been pursued successfully thus far, producing systems capable of evading almost all major obstacles to transfection. Evaluating the abilities of non-viral and viral vectors to overcome specific cellular barriers reveals that the greatest advantage of viral vectors may be related to viral DNA, which is transcribed considerably more efficiently than plasmid DNA. Further study in this area should enable the development of non-viral vectors that transfect as efficiently as viral vectors.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Lung macrophages have been reported to regulate both progression and remission of bleomycin-induced diffuse PF. However, it remains unclear how macrophages contribute to silica-induced progressive nodular PF and the associated tissue cell responses in vivo. We found that lack of monocyte-derived macrophages results in the formation of diffuse PF after silica instillation. We found that the proportion and the number of monocyte-derived macrophages were persistently higher in silica-induced progressive PF compared with bleomycin-induced PF. Surprisingly, in Ccr2-/-mice, in which monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration is impaired, silica administration induced diffuse PF with loose nodule formation and greater activation of tissue cells. In the diffuse lesions, the distribution of epithelial cells, distribution of myofibroblasts, and architecture of the basement membrane were disrupted. Consistent with the development of diffuse lesions, genes that were differentially expressed in CD45-tissue cells from the lung of wild-type and Ccr2-/-mice were highly enriched in human diffuse, progressive PF. In gene ontology network analyses, many of these genes were associated with tissue remodeling and included genes not previously associated with PF, such as Mmp14, Thbs2, and Fgfr4. Overall, these results indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages prevent transition from nodular to diffuse silica-induced PF, potentially by regulating tissue cell responses.},

abstract = {Background aims: Adult stem cell-based therapy is a promising novel approach for treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of isolated human peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells in an ALI rat model, induced by oleic acid (OA) injection. Methods: Seventy-five adult female rats were used in this study. Group A, control without treatment, and group B, control injected with phosphate-buffered saline, comprised 15 rats each; the remaining 45 rats were injected with OA to induce ALI and were further subdivided into 3 groups: group C (ALI group, 15 rats), group D (ALI and fibroblast group, 15 rats) and group E (ALI and CD34+ cell group, 15 rats). Results: CD34+ cells transplantation in rats with OA-induced lung injury improves the arterial PaO2and wet/dry ratio, reduces infiltration of inflammatory cells and decreases lung vascular permeability as determined by reduced intra-alveolar and interstitial patchy congestion and hemorrhage as well as decreased interstitial edema. Additionally, lung inflammation determined by expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumor necrosis factor-{\$}\alpha{\$} was attenuated in CD34+ cell-treated rats at 6, 24 and 48 h post-OA challenge compared with non-treated rats. Moreover, the expression of anti-inflammatory molecule interleukin-10 was up-regulated in the lung of OA-induced ALI rats after administration of CD34+ cells. The important finding was that human TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$}-induced protein 6 (TSG-6) gene expression was significantly up-regulated in rats treated with CD34+ cells. Conclusions: The freshly isolated human peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells may be used as an important source of stem cells that improve ALI. The anti-inflammatory properties of CD34+ cells in the lung are explained, at least in part, by activation of CD34+ cells to express TSG-6.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology. Interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ plays an important role in inflammation and has been associated with fibrotic remodelling. We investigated the balance between IL-1$\beta$ and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum as well as the influence of genetic variability in the IL1B and IL1RN gene on disease susceptibility and cytokine levels. In 77 IPF patients and 349 healthy controls, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL1RN and IL1B genes were determined. Serum and BALF IL-1Ra and IL-1$\beta$ levels were measured using a multiplex suspension bead array system and were correlated with genotypes. Both in serum and BALF a significantly decreased IL-1Ra/IL-1$\beta$ ratio was found in IPF patients compared to healthy controls. In the IL1RN gene, one SNP was associated with both the susceptibility to IPF and reduced IL-1Ra/IL-1$\beta$ ratios in BALF. Our results show that genetic variability in the IL1RN gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF and that this role may be more important than thought until recently. The imbalance between IL-1Ra and IL-1$\beta$ might contribute to a proinflammatory and pro-fibrotic environment in their lungs.},

abstract = {During inflammation, leukocytes influx into lung compartments and interact with extracellular matrix (ECM). Two ECM components, versican and hyaluronan, increase in a range of lung diseases. The interaction of leukocytes with these ECM components controls leukocyte retention and accumulation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and activation as part of the inflammatory phase of lung disease. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic children co-cultured with human lung fibroblasts generate an ECM that is adherent for monocytes/macrophages. Macrophages are present in both early and late lung inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10) is induced in alveolar macrophages with injury and infection and modulates macrophage phenotype and their ability to degrade collagenous ECM components. Collectively, studies outlined in this review highlight the importance of specific ECM components in the regulation of inflammatory events in lung disease. The widespread involvement of these ECM components in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation make them attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is synthesized in the liver and in macrophages, and it has antiatherogenic properties that are mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of plasma cholesterol homeostasis. Previous data suggest that apoE also has antiinflammatory properties that may contribute to protection against atherosclerosis independent of its role in lipid metabolism. In this study, apoE knockout and C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We show that apoE modulates the systemic type I inflammatory response in vivo. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and interferon-gamma were upregulated to a significantly greater extent in apoE-deficient mice than in wild-type mice at both the mRNA and protein levels following administration of LPS. In contrast, hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein receptor/apobec-1 double knockout mice had a similar cytokine response as wild-type mice, eliminating hypercholesterolemia as a cause for the exaggerated cytokine response. Importantly, reconstitution of apoE expression in the liver of apoE-deficient mice normalized the LPS-induced plasma protein levels of IL-12p40. Furthermore, there was selective upregulation of plasma IL-12 in apoE knockout mice by a TLR3 agonist, poly I:C, but not by other TLR agonists, CpG oligonucleotide or Toxoplasma gondii antigen. This implies that apoE selectively regulates TLR4- and TLR3-mediated signaling of IL-12 production. These results indicate that apoE modulates the T helper-1-type immune response in vivo by modulating IL-12 production.},

Although -CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes (CCR2⁺Mo) and their derivatives initiate adaptive pulmonary immune responses, their role in coordinating innate immune responses in the lung remain poorly defined. Using conditional and antibody-mediated cell ablation strategies, we found that CCR2⁺Mo and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) are essential for innate defense against inhaled conidia. By harnessing fluorescent Aspergillus reporter (FLARE) conidia that report fungal cell association and viability in vivo, we identify two mechanisms by which CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs exert innate antifungal activity. First, CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs condition the lung inflammatory milieu to augment neutrophil conidiacidal activity. Second, conidial uptake by CCR2⁺Mo temporally coincided with their differentiation into Mo-DCs, a process that resulted in direct conidial killing. Our findings illustrate both indirect and direct functions for CCR2⁺Mo and their derivatives in innate antifungal immunity in the lung.},

In this paper, we compare the performance of different competing methods to model data with zero inflated features through extensive simulations and application to a microbiome study. These methods include standard parametric and non-parametric models, hurdle models, and zero inflated models. We examine varying degrees of zero inflation, with or without dispersion in the count component, as well as different magnitude and direction of the covariate effect on structural zeros and the count components. We focus on the assessment of type I error, power to detect the overall covariate effect, measures of model fit, and bias and effectiveness of parameter estimations. We also evaluate the abilities of model selection strategies using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Vuong test to identify the correct model. The simulation studies show that hurdle and zero inflated models have well controlled type I errors, higher power, better goodness of fit measures, and are more accurate and efficient in the parameter estimation. Besides that, the hurdle models have similar goodness of fit and parameter estimation for the count component as their corresponding zero inflated models. However, the estimation and interpretation of the parameters for the zero components differs, and hurdle models are more stable when structural zeros are absent. We then discuss the model selection strategy for zero inflated data and implement it in a gut microbiome study of {\textgreater} 400 independent subjects.},

As a role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been discussed, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be involved in the initiation of a first immune reaction. We analyzed expression and functional relevance of several TLRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. In parallel, we determined the release of C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 by BAL cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 1 and 2, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR9 expression by BAL cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Chemokine release was measured in BAL cell culture supernatants by ELISA. We found increased TLR9 mRNA expression in patients with sarcoidosis with chest X-ray type I and II and TLR9 protein expression in BAL cells from patients with chest X-ray type II and III. Stimulation with CpG nucleotides increased CXCL10 release by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis type II significantly compared with control subjects or other patients with sarcoidosis. In contrast, no increase in TNF, IL-12p40, or CXCL8 was detected. Spontaneous release of CXCL10, but not CXCL9 or CXCL11, by cultured BAL cells was also highest in cells from patients with chest X-ray type II. We found a significant association between TLR9 expression and CD4(+) lymphocytes in BAL. Our data demonstrate that TLR9 ligands may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis via induction of CXCL10 release in the alveolar macrophages.},

abstract = {The first steps in the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data are usually to map the reads to a reference genome and then to count reads by gene, by exon or by exon-exon junction. These two steps are at once the most common and also typically the most expensive computational steps in an RNA-seq analysis. These steps are typically undertaken using Unix command-line or Python software tools, even when downstream analysis is to be undertaken using R. We present Rsubread, a Bioconductor software package that provides high-performance alignment and counting functions for RNA-seq reads. Rsubread provides the ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It has no software dependencies other than R itself. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to the popular non-R tools TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq. We also compare to counting functions provided in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We show that Rsubread is faster, uses less memory and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus represent a great challenge for immunocompromised patients. Pathogen detection is mediated by different receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins, and pentraxines. However, little is known about their relevance for immature human dendritic cells (iDCs). Methods: The gene expression pattern of iDCs after exposure to A. fumigatus germ tubes was studied by use of whole genome microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fungal receptors were targeted by means of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which were used to knock down expression of TLR2, TLR4, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin), PTX3 (pentraxin-related gene), dectin-1 (C-type lectin domain family 7, member A), and CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family, member 9). RESULTS: Exposure to A. fumigatus induced expression of cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, as well as genes related to fungal recognition and phagocytosis. Silencing of dectin-1 resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12), which was also reduced by anti-Dectin-1 antibody treatment prior to exposure to A. fumigatus, zymosan, or Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: Dectin-1 was identified as an important receptor for A. fumigatus and C. albicans on human iDCs and was found to be involved in the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine response.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

Our aim was to compare the effect of probiotics vs placebo on hepatic, inflammatory and clinical outcomes following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).Methods:This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial of 6-month treatment with probiotics (Bio-25; Supherb) vs placebo and 6 months of additional follow-up was conducted among 100 morbidly obese nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients who underwent LSG surgery. The primary outcome was a reduction in liver fat content, measured by abdominal ultrasound, and secondary outcomes were improvement of fibrosis, measured by shear-wave elastography, metabolic and inflammatory parameters, anthropometrics and quality of life (QOL). Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for microbial composition.Results:One hundred patients (60{\%} women, mean age of 41.9±9.8 years and body mass index of 42.3±4.7 kg m '2) were randomized, 80{\%} attended the 6-month visit and 77{\%} completed the 12-month follow-up.

abstract = {Typical data in a microbiome study consist of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts that have the characteristic of excess zeros, which are often ignored by investigators. In this paper, we compare the performance of different competing methods to model data with zero inflated features through extensive simulations and application to a microbiome study. These methods include standard parametric and non-parametric models, hurdle models, and zero inflated models. We examine varying degrees of zero inflation, with or without dispersion in the count component, as well as different magnitude and direction of the covariate effect on structural zeros and the count components. We focus on the assessment of type I error, power to detect the overall covariate effect, measures of model fit, and bias and effectiveness of parameter estimations. We also evaluate the abilities of model selection strategies using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Vuong test to identify the correct model. The simulation studies show that hurdle and zero inflated models have well controlled type I errors, higher power, better goodness of fit measures, and are more accurate and efficient in the parameter estimation. Besides that, the hurdle models have similar goodness of fit and parameter estimation for the count component as their corresponding zero inflated models. However, the estimation and interpretation of the parameters for the zero components differs, and hurdle models are more stable when structural zeros are absent. We then discuss the model selection strategy for zero inflated data and implement it in a gut microbiome study of {\textgreater}400 independent subjects.},

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-13 is a major inducer of fibrosis in many chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. In studies of the mechanisms underlying such induction, we found that IL-13 induces transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 in macrophages through a two-stage process involving, first, the induction of a receptor formerly considered to function only as a decoy receptor, IL-13R2. Such induction requires IL-13 (or IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. Second, it involves IL-13 signaling through IL-13R2 to activate an AP-1 variant containing c-jun and Fra-2, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter. In vivo, we found that prevention of IL-13R2 expression reduced production of TGF-1 in oxazolone-induced colitis and that prevention of IL-13R2 expression, Il13ra2 gene silencing or blockade of IL-13R2 signaling led to marked downregulation of TGF-1 production and collagen deposition in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. These data suggest that IL-13R2 signaling during prolonged inflammation is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of TGF-1–mediated fibrosis.},

abstract = {Motivation RNA-seq has emerged as a powerful technology for the detection of differential gene expression in the transcriptome. The commonly used statistical methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis were designed for individual genes, which may detect too many irrelevant significantly genes or too few genes to interpret the phenotypic changes. Recently network module-based methods have been proposed as a powerful approach to analyze and interpret expression data in microarray and shotgun proteomics. But the module-based statistical model has not been adequately addressed for RNA-seq data. Result we proposed a network module-based generalized linear model for differential expression analysis of the count-based sequencing data from RNA-seq. The simulation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model and the improvement of the statistical power for identifying the differentially expressed modules in comparison to the existing methods. We also applied our method to tissue datasets and identified 207 significantly differentially expressed kidney-active or liver-active modules. For liver cancer datasets, significantly differentially expressed modules, including Wnt signaling pathway and VEGF pathway, were found to be tightly associated with liver cancer. Besides, in comparison with the single gene-level analysis, our method could identify more significantly biological modules, which related to the liver cancer.

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of lethal, chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Over the past decade, macrophage has been recognized to play a significant role in IPF pathogenesis. Depending on the local microenvironments, macrophages can be polarized to either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. In general, M1 macrophages are responsible for wound healing after alveolar epithelial injury, while M2 macrophages are designated to resolve wound healing processes or terminate inflammatory responses in the lung. IPF is a pathological consequence resulted from altered wound healing in response to persistent lung injury. In this review, we intend to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the process of macrophage polarization and its mediators in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our goal is to update the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of IPF, and by which, we expect to provide help for developing effective therapeutic strategies in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Findings from clinical and biological studies are often not reproducible when tested in independent cohorts. Due to the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, results from whole-genome expression studies in particular are often not reproducible. Compared to single-study analysis, gene expression meta-analysis can improve reproducibility by integrating data from multiple studies. However, there are multiple choices in designing and carrying out a meta-analysis. Yet, clear guidelines on best practices are scarce. Here, we hypothesized that studying subsets of very large meta-analyses would allow for systematic identification of best practices to improve reproducibility. We therefore constructed three very large gene expression meta-analyses from clinical samples, and then examined meta-analyses of subsets of the datasets (all combinations of datasets with up to N/2 samples and K/2 datasets) compared to a 'silver standard' of differentially expressed genes found in the entire cohort. We tested three random-effects meta-analysis models using this procedure. We showed relatively greater reproducibility with more-stringent effect size thresholds with relaxed significance thresholds; relatively lower reproducibility when imposing extraneous constraints on residual heterogeneity; and an underestimation of actual false positive rate by Benjamini-Hochberg correction. In addition, multivariate regression showed that the accuracy of a meta-analysis increased significantly with more included datasets even when controlling for sample size.},

abstract = {Macrophages are unique cells for origin, heterogeneity and plasticity. At steady state most of macrophages are derived from fetal sources and maintained in adulthood through self-renewing. Despite sharing common progenitors, a remarkable heterogeneity characterized tissue-resident macrophages indicating that local signals educate them to express organ-specific functions. Macrophages are extremely plastic: chromatin landscape and transcriptional programs can be dynamically re-shaped in response to microenvironmental changes. Owing to their ductility, macrophages are crucial orchestrators of both initiation and resolution of immune responses and key supporters of tissue development and functions in homeostatic and pathological conditions. Herein, we describe current understanding of heterogeneity and plasticity of macrophages using the M1-M2 dichotomy as operationally useful simplification of polarized activation. We focused on the complex network of signaling cascades, metabolic pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic changes that control macrophage activation. In particular, this network was addressed in sepsis, as a paradigm of a pathological condition determining dynamic macrophage reprogramming.},

abstract = {Data from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses. Effects on normalization: Most normalization methods enable successful clustering of samples according to biological origin when the groups differ substantially in their overall microbial composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters samples according to biological origin than other normalization techniques do for ordination metrics based on presence or absence. Alternate normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to artifacts due to library size. Effects on differential abundance testing: We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of many differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available data. For groups with large ({\~{}}10×) differences in the average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate. DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on smaller datasets ({\textless}20 samples per group) but tends towards a higher false discovery rate with more samples, very uneven ({\~{}}10×) library sizes, and/or compositional effects. For drawing inferences regarding taxon abundance in the ecosystem, analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) is not only very sensitive (for {\textgreater}20 samples per group) but also critically the only method tested that has a good control of false discovery rate. These findings guide which normalization and differential abundance techniques to use based on the data characteristics of a given study.},

We performed a meta-analysis of seven studies (a total of 1825 stool samples from 684 infants) to investigate effects of EBF compared to non-EBF on infant gut microbiota across different populations. In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age. These consistent findings across vastly different populations suggest that one of the mechanisms of short and long-term benefits of EBF may be alteration in gut microbes.},

Ten-week-old Wistar male rats were divided into four groups: (1) oleic acid injected into caudal vein after heat exposure, (2) oleic acid injected without heat exposure, (3) soybean oil injected after heat exposure, and (4) soybean oil injected without heat exposure, and then mRNA expression of eight inflammatory mediators related to ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in lung was determined 1. h after the injection. mRNA expression of interleukin 1 beta (Il1b), tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa), transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1) and Hsp70 was significantly increased by heat exposure, while that of Il1b, interleukin 6 (Il6), Tnfa, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (Mip2) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (Gm-csf) was significantly elevated by the injection of oleic acid. Moreover, the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung almost paralleled their mRNA expressions. In particular, IL-1$\beta$ expression was synergistically elevated by heat exposure followed by injection of oleic acid. Additionally, IL-6 expression tended to increase under the same conditions as well. It is likely that heat exposure itself injures lung tissue within a short time, and that more than two conditions which induce ALI/ARDS interact with each other synergistically, exacerbating the development of ALI/ARDS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background TH2 cells can further differentiate into dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells. The presence of dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in the airways and their effect on asthma severity are unknown. Objective We sought to study dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from asthmatic patients, examine their response to glucocorticoids, and define their relevance for disease severity. Methods Bronchoscopy and lavage were performed in 52 asthmatic patients and 25 disease control subjects. TH2 and TH2/TH17 cells were analyzed by using multicolor flow cytometry and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytokines were assayed by means of ELISA. Results Dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells were present at a higher frequency in BAL fluid from asthmatic patients compared with numbers seen in disease control subjects. High-level IL-4 production was typically accompanied by high-level IL-17 production and coexpression of GATA3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor {\$}\gamma{\$}t. Increased presence of TH2/TH17 cells was associated with increased IL-17 production in lavage fluid. TH2/TH17 cell counts and IL-17 production correlated with PC20 for methacholine, eosinophil counts, and FEV1. TH2/TH17 cells, unlike TH2 cells, were resistant to dexamethasone-induced cell death. They expressed higher levels of mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1, a molecule that induces glucocorticoid resistance. On the basis of the dominance of BAL fluid TH2 or TH2/TH17 cells, we identified 3 subgroups of asthma: TH2predominant, TH2/TH17predominant, and TH2/TH17low. The TH2/TH17predominant subgroup manifested the most severe form of asthma, whereas the TH2/TH17low subgroup had the mildest asthma. Conclusion Asthma is associated with a higher frequency of dual-positive TH2/TH17 cells in BAL fluid. The TH2/TH17predominant subgroup of asthmatic patients manifested glucocorticoid resistance in vitro. They also had the greatest airway obstruction and hyperreactivity compared with the TH2predominant and TH2/TH17low subgroups.},

abstract = {A large variety of fungi are present in the environment, among which a proportion colonizes the human body, usually without causing any harm. However, depending on the host immune status, commensals can become opportunistic pathogens that induce diseases ranging from superficial non-harmful infection to life-threatening systemic disease. The interplay between the host and the fungal commensal flora is being orchestrated by an efficient recognition of the microorganisms, which in turn ensures a proper balance between tolerance of the normal fungal flora and induction of immune defense mechanisms when invasion occurs. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a significant role in maintaining this balance due to their capacity to sense fungi and induce host responses such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines involved in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In the present review, we will discuss the most recent findings regarding the recognition of Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus and the different types of immune cells that play a role in antifungal host defense.},

abstract = {Emerging roles are being recognized increasingly for apolipoproteins in the pathogenesis and treatment of lung diseases on the basis of their ability to suppress inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling, and to promote adaptive immunity and host defense. Apolipoproteins, such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), are important components of lipoprotein particles that facilitate the transport of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids between plasma and cells. ApoE- containing lipoprotein particles are internalized into cells by low- density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs), whereas apoA-I can interact with the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) transporter to efflux cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells. ApoE and apoA-I also mediate receptor-independent effects, such as binding to and neutralizing LPS. Both apoE and apoA-I are expressed by lung cells, which allows apoE/LDLR- and apoA-I/ABCA1- dependent pathways to modulate normal lung health and the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, including asthma, acute lung injury, cancer, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Data from human studies and research using experimental murine model systems have shown that both apoE and apoA-I pathways play primarily protective roles in lung biology and respiratory disease. Furthermore, apolipoprotein mimetic peptides, corresponding to the LDLR-binding domain of apoE or the class A amphipathic a-helical structure of apoA-I, have antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects that attenuate the severity of lung disease in murine models. Thus, the development of inhaled apolipoprotein mimetic peptides as a novel treatment paradigm could represent a significant advance for patients with respiratory disease who do not respond to current therapies.},

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence, risk factors and impact of acute exacerbations, and other known causes of rapid deterioration. This was a retrospective review of 461 patients with IPF (269 cases were biopsy-proven). The median follow-up period was 22.9 months. Rapid deterioration requiring hospitalisation occurred in 163 (35.4{\%}) patients, with multiple episodes in 42 patients. Acute exacerbation was the most frequent cause (55.2{\%}), followed by infection. The 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low forced vital capacity (FVC) were significant risk factors. The in-hospital mortality rate was 50.0{\%}, and the 1- and 5-yr survival rates from the initial diagnosis were 56.2 and 18.4{\%}, respectively. Acute exacerbation was a significant predictor of poor survival after the initial diagnosis, along with increased age, low FVC and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and steroid use with or without cytotoxic therapy. 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low FVC were risk factors. Acute exacerbation had a serious impact on the overall survival of the patients with IPF.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Much research effort has been devoted to the identification of enriched gene sets for microarray experiments. However, identified gene sets are often found to be inconsistent among independent studies. This is probably owing to the noisy data of microarray experiments coupled with small sample sizes of individual studies. Therefore, combining information from multiple studies is likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes. As more and more data become available, it calls for statistical methods to integrate information from multiple studies, also known as meta-analysis, to improve the power of identifying enriched gene sets. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian model that provides a coherent framework for joint modeling of both gene set information and gene expression data from multiple studies, to improve the detection of enriched gene sets by leveraging information from different sources available. One distinct feature of our method is that it directly models the gene expression data, instead of using summary statistics, when synthesizing studies. Besides, the proposed model is flexible and offers an appropriate treatment of between-study heterogeneities that frequently arise in the meta-analysis of microarray experiments. We show that under our Bayesian model, the full posterior conditionals all have known distributions, which greatly facilitates the MCMC computation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the power of gene set enrichment meta-analysis, as opposed to existing methods developed by Shen and Tseng (2010, Bioinformatics, 26, 1316-1323), and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations from the distributional assumption for gene expression data. We illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining eight lung cancer datasets for gene set enrichment analysis, which demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for severe, invasive infections in neutropenic hosts. Lung clearance of A. fumigatus conidia seems to be mediated by phagocytic cells and oxygen radicals. It is not known if cytokines or nitrogen radicals are also involved. We tested for the production of TNF alpha, IL-1 and nitric oxide (NO) after stimulation of mouse macrophages with the fungus. We found that both cytokines, but not NO, were produced in a dose-dependent manner during the first 24 h of culture. Except for a faster kinetic, no appreciable differences were seen between alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, both hyphae and conidia, either alive or killed, were capable of inducing cytokines production. However, among different Aspergillus spp. only A. fumigatus and A. flavus seemed to induce significant amount of TNF alpha and IL-1, whereas A. terreus and A. niger were less effective. In no case could we detect production of NO. Finally, macrophages from dexamethasone-treated mice failed to produce cytokines in response to A. fumigatus conidia. These results indicate that in normal hosts inflammatory cytokines contribute to the natural response against Aspergillus infections and suggest that the impairment of cytokine production, in immunodepressed patients, may favour the growth and spread of the fungus},

Results from individual studies can be inconsistent, and comparing published data is further complicated by a lack of standard processing and analysis methods. Here we introduce the MicrobiomeHD database, which includes 28 published case–control gut microbiome studies spanning ten diseases. We perform a cross-disease meta-analysis of these studies using standardized methods. We find consistent patterns characterizing disease-associated microbiome changes. Some diseases are associated with over 50 genera, while most show only 10–15 genus-level changes. Some diseases are marked by the presence of potentially pathogenic microbes, whereas others are characterized by a depletion of health-associated bacteria. Furthermore, we show that about half of genera associated with individual studies are bacteria that respond to more than one disease. Thus, many associations found in case–control studies are likely not disease-specific but rather part of a non-specific, shared response to health and disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is known that tissue macrophages derive not only from blood monocytes but also from yolk sac or fetal liver, and the tissue of residence guides their function. When isolated, they lose tissue specific signatures, hence studies of human macrophages should be ideally done directly in the tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate directly in human lung tissue the polarization of alveolar macrophage (AM), classic (M1) or alternative (M2), in health and disease, using COPD as a model. METHODS Surgical lungs from 53 subjects were studied: 36 smokers whose FEV1 varied from normal to severe COPD, 11 non-smokers and 6 normal donors. iNOS and CD206 immunohistochemistry was used to quantify the percentage of AM polarized as M1 or M2 in lung sections. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The percentage of M1 and M2 increased progressively with smoking and COPD severity, from 26{\%} to 84{\%} for M1 and from 7{\%} to 78{\%} for M2. In donors 74{\%} of AM were negative for M1 and 93{\%} for M2. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of M1 and M2 in the same AM in severe COPD. CONCLUSION In normal lungs alveolar macrophages were mostly non-polarized. With smoking and COPD severity, M1 and M2 polarization increased significantly and so did the co-expression of M1 and M2 in the same alveolar macrophage.},

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade all of the extracellular matrix components of the intersititium and may play a role in abnormal alveolar permeability, which is a feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The aims of the present study were to evaluate MMP protein levels in patients with IPF and determine any relationship to treatment and markers of permeability. In total, 20 patients with IPF and eight normal controls underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. MMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were related to clinical outcome and protein permeability index. MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9 were elevated in IPF lavage fluid and levels remained high despite treatment. Levels of MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9, VEGF and protein permeability index were higher in those who died early during follow-up. VEGF, and MMP-8 and -9 levels were higher in those with a rapidly declining lung function over 1 yr. Levels of MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9 correlated with an increased permeability index. Matrix metalloproteinase levels were elevated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and were not modulated by current standard treatment. Matrix metalloproteinase production through an interaction with the known vascular permogen, vascular endothelial growth factor, was potentially associated with abnormal capillary permeability and may have potentiated the neo-angiogenesis seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The changes were greatest in those who died or progressed during follow-up, suggesting that drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor or matrix metalloproteinase activity warrant assessment as novel therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

In 3.5 million measured cells, we identified 17 tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes, 22 T cell phenotypes, and a distinct immune composition correlated with progression-free survival, thereby presenting an in-depth human atlas of the immune tumor microenvironment in this disease. This study revealed potential biomarkers and targets for immunotherapy development and validated tools that can be used for immune profiling of other tumor types.},

abstract = {In recent decades there has been a significant shift in our understanding of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and lethal disorder. While initially much of the mechanistic understanding was derived from hypotheses generated from animal models of disease, in recent decades new insights derived from humans with IPF have taken precedence. This is mainly because of the establishment of large collections of IPF lung tissues and patient cohorts, and the emergence of high throughput profiling technologies collectively termed ‘omics' technologies based on their shared suffix. In this review we describe impacts of ‘omics' analyses of human IPF samples on our understanding of the disease. In particular, we discuss the results of genomics and transcriptomics studies, as well as proteomics, epigenomics and metabolomics. We then describe how these findings can be integrated in a modified paradigm of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, that introduces the ‘hallmarks of aging' as a central theme in the IPF lung. This allows resolution of all the disparate cellular and molecular features in IPF, from the central role of epithelial cells, through the dramatic phenotypic alterations observed in fibroblasts and the numerous aberrations that inflammatory cells exhibit. We end with reiterating a call for renewed efforts to collect and analyze carefully characterized human tissues, in ways that would facilitate implementation of novel technologies for high resolution single cell omics profiling.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and remodeling of the lung architecture. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered the most common and severe form of the disease, with a median survival of approximately three years and no proven effective therapy. Despite the fact that effective treatments are absent and the precise mechanisms that drive fibrosis in most patients remain incompletely understood, an extensive body of scientific literature regarding pulmonary fibrosis has accumulated over the past 35 years. In this review, we discuss three broad areas which have been explored that may be responsible for the combination of altered lung fibroblasts, loss of alveolar epithelial cells, and excessive accumulation of ECM: inflammation and immune mechanisms, oxidative stress and oxidative signaling, and procoagulant mechanisms. We discuss each of these processes separately to facilitate clarity, but certainly significant interplay will occur amongst these pathways in patients with this disease.},

abstract = {Although macrophages are widely recognized to have a profibrotic role in inflammation, we have used a highly tractable CCl(4)-induced model of reversible hepatic fibrosis to identify and characterize the macrophage phenotype responsible for tissue remodeling: the hitherto elusive restorative macrophage. This CD11B(hi) F4/80(int) Ly-6C(lo) macrophage subset was most abundant in livers during maximal fibrosis resolution and represented the principle matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -expressing subset. Depletion of this population in CD11B promoter-diphtheria toxin receptor (CD11B-DTR) transgenic mice caused a failure of scar remodeling. Adoptive transfer and in situ labeling experiments showed that these restorative macrophages derive from recruited Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, a common origin with profibrotic Ly-6C(hi) macrophages, indicative of a phenotypic switch in vivo conferring proresolution properties. Microarray profiling of the Ly-6C(lo) subset, compared with Ly-6C(hi) macrophages, showed a phenotype outside the M1/M2 classification, with increased expression of MMPs, growth factors, and phagocytosis-related genes, including Mmp9, Mmp12, insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), and Glycoprotein (transmembrane) nmb (Gpnmb). Confocal microscopy confirmed the postphagocytic nature of restorative macrophages. Furthermore, the restorative macrophage phenotype was recapitulated in vitro by the phagocytosis of cellular debris with associated activation of the ERK signaling cascade. Critically, induced phagocytic behavior in vivo, through administration of liposomes, increased restorative macrophage number and accelerated fibrosis resolution, offering a therapeutic strategy to this orphan pathological process.},

abstract = { The microorganisms that inhabit hospitals may influence patient recovery and outcome, although the complexity and diversity of these bacterial communities can confound our ability to focus on potential pathogens in isolation. To develop a community-level understanding of how microorganisms colonize and move through the hospital environment, we characterized the bacterial dynamics among hospital surfaces, patients, and staff over the course of 1 year as a new hospital became operational. The bacteria in patient rooms, particularly on bedrails, consistently resembled the skin microbiota of the patient occupying the room. Bacterial communities on patients and room surfaces became increasingly similar over the course of a patient's stay. Temporal correlations in community structure demonstrated that patients initially acquired room-associated taxa that predated their stay but that their own microbial signatures began to influence the room community structure over time. The $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity of patient skin samples were only weakly or nonsignificantly associated with clinical factors such as chemotherapy, antibiotic usage, and surgical recovery, and no factor except for ambulatory status affected microbial similarity between the microbiotas of a patient and their room. Metagenomic analyses revealed that genes conferring antimicrobial resistance were consistently more abundant on room surfaces than on the skin of the patients inhabiting those rooms. In addition, persistent unique genotypes of Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium were identified. Dynamic Bayesian network analysis suggested that hospital staff were more likely to be a source of bacteria on the skin of patients than the reverse but that there were no universal patterns of transmission across patient rooms. },

We performed a meta-analysis of seven studies (a total of 1825 stool samples from 684 infants) to investigate effects of EBF compared to non-EBF on infant gut microbiota across different populations. In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age. These consistent findings across vastly different populations suggest that one of the mechanisms of short and long-term benefits of EBF may be alteration in gut microbes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and variable clinical course. Although matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is emerging as an important IPF biomarker, reproducibility across studies is unclear. We aimed to determine whether a previously reported prognostic threshold for MMP-7 was predictive of mortality in an independent cohort of IPF patients. METHODS MMP-7 concentrations obtained from heparinized plasma samples were determined by ELISA in 97 patients with IPF and 41 healthy controls. The association of the previously published heparin plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL with all-cause mortality or transplant-free survival (TFS) was determined, either as an independent biomarker or as part of the modified personal clinical and molecular mortality index (m-PCMI). RESULTS MMP-7 plasma concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to healthy controls (14.40 ± 6.55 ng/mL vs 6.03 ± 2.51 ng/mL, P {\textless} 0.001). The plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality and TFS (unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) = 25.85 and 15.49, 95{\%} CI: 10.91-61.23 and 5.41-44.34, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). MMP-7 concentrations, split by 12.1 ng/mL, were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) predictive of mortality and TFS after adjusting for age, gender, smoking and baseline pulmonary function parameters, in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. MMP-7 concentrations were negatively correlated with diffusing lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO ) (r = -0.21, P = 0.02), and positively with a mortality risk scoring system (GAP) that combines age, gender, forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO (r = 0.32, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This study confirms that MMP-7 concentrations could be used to accurately predict outcomes across cohorts and centres, when similar collection protocols are applied.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

CD4(+) T cells which produce type 2 cytokines can be generated via IL-4-dependent and -independent pathways. Although the IL-4-dependent pathway is well documented, factors that drive IL-4-independent Th2 cell differentiation remain obscure. We report here that the new cytokine IL-33, in the presence of Ag, polarizes murine and human naive CD4(+) T cells into a population of T cells which produce mainly IL-5 but not IL-4. This polarization requires IL-1R-related molecule and MyD88 but not IL-4 or STAT6. The IL-33-induced T cell differentiation is also dependent on the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-kappaB but not the induction of GATA3 or T-bet. In vivo, ST2(-/-) mice developed attenuated airway inflammation and IL-5 production in a murine model of asthma. Conversely, IL-33 administration induced the IL-5-producing T cells and exacerbated allergen-induced airway inflammation in wild-type as well as IL-4(-/-) mice. Finally, adoptive transfer of IL-33-polarized IL-5(+)IL-4(-)T cells triggered airway inflammation in naive IL-4(-/-) mice. Thus, we demonstrate here that, in the presence of Ag, IL-33 induces IL-5-producing T cells and promotes airway inflammation independent of IL-4.},

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-13 is a major inducer of fibrosis in many chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. In studies of the mechanisms underlying such induction, we found that IL-13 induces transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 in macrophages through a two-stage process involving, first, the induction of a receptor formerly considered to function only as a decoy receptor, IL-13R2. Such induction requires IL-13 (or IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. Second, it involves IL-13 signaling through IL-13R2 to activate an AP-1 variant containing c-jun and Fra-2, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter. In vivo, we found that prevention of IL-13R2 expression reduced production of TGF-1 in oxazolone-induced colitis and that prevention of IL-13R2 expression, Il13ra2 gene silencing or blockade of IL-13R2 signaling led to marked downregulation of TGF-1 production and collagen deposition in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. These data suggest that IL-13R2 signaling during prolonged inflammation is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of TGF-1–mediated fibrosis.},

abstract = {In addition to the directly mutagenic effects of energy deposition in DNA, ionizing radiation is associated with a variety of untargeted and delayed effects that result in ongoing bone marrow damage. Delayed effects are genotype dependent with CBA/Ca mice, but not C57BL/6 mice, susceptible to the induction of damage and also radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrophages are a potential source of ongoing damaging signals, we have determined their gene expression profiles and we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages show widely different intrinsic expression patterns. The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure.},

abstract = {Emerging roles are being recognized increasingly for apolipoproteins in the pathogenesis and treatment of lung diseases on the basis of their ability to suppress inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling, and to promote adaptive immunity and host defense. Apolipoproteins, such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), are important components of lipoprotein particles that facilitate the transport of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids between plasma and cells. ApoE- containing lipoprotein particles are internalized into cells by low- density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs), whereas apoA-I can interact with the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) transporter to efflux cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells. ApoE and apoA-I also mediate receptor-independent effects, such as binding to and neutralizing LPS. Both apoE and apoA-I are expressed by lung cells, which allows apoE/LDLR- and apoA-I/ABCA1- dependent pathways to modulate normal lung health and the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, including asthma, acute lung injury, cancer, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Data from human studies and research using experimental murine model systems have shown that both apoE and apoA-I pathways play primarily protective roles in lung biology and respiratory disease. Furthermore, apolipoprotein mimetic peptides, corresponding to the LDLR-binding domain of apoE or the class A amphipathic a-helical structure of apoA-I, have antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects that attenuate the severity of lung disease in murine models. Thus, the development of inhaled apolipoprotein mimetic peptides as a novel treatment paradigm could represent a significant advance for patients with respiratory disease who do not respond to current therapies.},

abstract = {The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is the pathologic basis for a variety of incurable human chronic lung diseases. IL-17A, a glycoprotein secreted from IL-17–producing cells, has recently been shown to be a proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammation and autoimmune disease. In this study, we report that IL-17A increased the synthesis and secretion of collagen and promoted the epithelial–mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells in a TGF-b1–dependent manner. Using in vivo fibrotic models, we found IL-17A expression to be elevated and IL-17A–associated signaling pathways to be activated in fibrotic lung tissues. Neutralization of IL-17A in vivo promoted the resolution of bleomycin-induced acute inflammation, attenuated pulmonary fibrosis, and increased survival. Additionally, IL-17A antagonism inhibited silica-induced chronic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting IL-17A resulted in a shift of the suppressive immune response in fibrotic lung tissue toward a Th1-type immune response, and it effectively induced autophagy, which promoted the autophagic degradation of collagen and autophagy-associated cell death. Moreover, IL-17A was found to attenuate the starvation-induced autophagy, and autophagy modulators regulated collagen degradation in the alveolar epithelial cells in a TGF-b1–independent manner. Administration of 3-methylamphetamine, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the therapeutic efficacy of IL-17A antagonism in pulmonary fibrosis. Our studies indicate that IL-17A participates in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis in both TGF-b1–dependent and –independent manners and that the components of the IL-17A signaling pathway are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of fibroproliferative lung diseases.},

abstract = {Background aims: Adult stem cell-based therapy is a promising novel approach for treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of isolated human peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells in an ALI rat model, induced by oleic acid (OA) injection. Methods: Seventy-five adult female rats were used in this study. Group A, control without treatment, and group B, control injected with phosphate-buffered saline, comprised 15 rats each; the remaining 45 rats were injected with OA to induce ALI and were further subdivided into 3 groups: group C (ALI group, 15 rats), group D (ALI and fibroblast group, 15 rats) and group E (ALI and CD34+ cell group, 15 rats). Results: CD34+ cells transplantation in rats with OA-induced lung injury improves the arterial PaO2and wet/dry ratio, reduces infiltration of inflammatory cells and decreases lung vascular permeability as determined by reduced intra-alveolar and interstitial patchy congestion and hemorrhage as well as decreased interstitial edema. Additionally, lung inflammation determined by expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ was attenuated in CD34+ cell-treated rats at 6, 24 and 48 h post-OA challenge compared with non-treated rats. Moreover, the expression of anti-inflammatory molecule interleukin-10 was up-regulated in the lung of OA-induced ALI rats after administration of CD34+ cells. The important finding was that human TNF-$\alpha$-induced protein 6 (TSG-6) gene expression was significantly up-regulated in rats treated with CD34+ cells. Conclusions: The freshly isolated human peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells may be used as an important source of stem cells that improve ALI. The anti-inflammatory properties of CD34+ cells in the lung are explained, at least in part, by activation of CD34+ cells to express TSG-6.},

Although microarrays have increased the rate of genomic data collection, sample size is still a major issue when identifying informative genetic biomarkers. Because of this, feature selection methods often suffer from false discoveries, resulting in poorly performing predictive models. We develop a simple meta-analysis-based feature selection method that captures the knowledge in each individual dataset and combines the results using a simple rank average. In a comprehensive study that measures robustness in terms of clinical application (i.e., breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer), microarray platform heterogeneity, and classifier (i.e., logistic regression, diagonal LDA, and linear SVM), we compare the rank average meta-analysis method to five other meta-analysis methods. Results indicate that rank average meta-analysis consistently performs well compared to five other meta-analysis methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

abstract = {Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and inter-connectivity of com- puter technology is creating unprecedented quantities of digital data. Data mining, the science of extracting useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as a young and interdisciplinary field in computer science. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, en- gineering and government, and it is widely believed that data mining will have profound impact on our society. The growing consensus that data mining can bring real value has led to an explosion in demand for novel data mining technologies and for students who are trained in data mining—students who have an understanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to real-life problems, and are trained for research and development of new data mining methods. Courses in data mining have started to sprawl all over the world. Based on this development of the field, the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee has set up the ACM SIGKDD Curriculum Committee to design a sample curriculum for data mining that gives recommendations for educating the next generation of students in data mining. Based on feedback from researchers, educators, and students, we are convinced that it is an important task to have a carefully designed, conceptually strong, technically rich, and balanced curriculum for this discipline. A comprehensive and balanced curriculum will ensure that the education in data mining sets a solid foundation for the healthy growth of the field, and it will promote systematic training of students in computer science, information sciences, and other related fields, and it will provide guidance for the training of the next generation of data mining researchers, developers and technology users. The Curriculum Committee is composed of university professors and researchers who have actively con- tributed to data mining research and education, researchers and practitioners from industry who have rich experiences in applying data mining technology, and administrators from government agencies. This report is the first draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Committee. We expect that this draft will be extensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forward to suggestions and recommendations from the Committee and from the general data mining research, development, and application community. The remainder of this report is structured as follows. First, we outline the principles that guided us in the selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief description of the prerequisites that we assume students of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Section 4 contains the core of this document, our curriculum proposal},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multi-series time-course microarray experiments are useful approaches for exploring biological processes. In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental groups. The large amount of data, multiplicity of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data analysis. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset.},

The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets.

In North America, many unsuspected cases are discovered by laboratory testing. The etiological agent, Treponema pallidum, cannot be cultured, and there is no single optimal alternative test. Serological testing is the most frequently used approach in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. The present paper discusses the various serological and alternative tests currently available along with their limitations, and relates their results to the likely corresponding clinical stage of the disease. The need to use multiple tests is discussed, and the importance of quality control is noted. The complexity of syphilis serology means that the services of reference laboratories and clinical experts are often needed.},

abstract = {I n an interesting paper, Scotton et al. (1) reported the ef-fects of IL-13 on the transcriptional profile of human monocytes. Comparing their results with studies analyz-ing the profile induced by IL-4 in murine macrophages (2, 3), the authors notice some differences, giving as examples up-reg-ulation of Ym1 and arginase-1 in murine macrophages, but not in human monocytes. The authors suggest these differences re-flect the fact that IL-4 and IL-13 are highly similar, yet different molecules. Besides overlapping effects with IL-4, IL-13 indeed has documented nonredundant functions and effects (4, 5). However, when comparing results obtained in murine macro-phages to human monocytes, differences between monocytes and differentiated macrophages, as well as interspecies differ-ences, may be involved. Indeed, human monocytes and mono-cyte-derived macrophages exhibit differences in their response to IL-4 and IL-13 (6). Moreover, we and others recently docu-mented that, similar to IL-13, IL-4 does not induce arginase-1 in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (7, 8), in contrast to murine macrophages, where the arginine me-tabolism is even one of the discriminative criteria between so-called alternatively and classically activated macrophages (9). Furthermore, in human monocytes, under conditions inducing mannose receptor and macrophage galactose-type C-type lec-tin, markers for IL-4/IL-13-induced, alternatively activated macrophages (7), we have not detected induction by IL-4 and IL-13 of eosinophil chemotactic cytokine, the closest human homolog of mouse Ym1 by sequence identity (Fig. 1). Overall, next to similarities, murine and human alternatively activated myeloid cells exhibit distinct differences. These should be taken into consideration to make optimal use of information obtained from murine models, and to relate it to the human situation.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abundant collagen production and accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) in the lower respiratory tract. Mechanisms as to how alveolar macrophages are activated by collagen breakdown products are unknown. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 37 healthy donors (HD). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in the presence of collagen type I, III, IV and V monomers w/wo a neutralizing antibody against scavenger receptor I class A (CD204). Culture supernatants were assayed for the M2 markers CCL18, CCL2, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) by ELISA. Furthermore, expression of phospho-Akt was measured using ELISA and expression of CD204 by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stimulation with collagen type I and III monomers significantly up-regulated CCL18, IL-1ra production of alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CD204 were up-regulated by collagen type I exposure. In addition, collagen type I stimulation increased pospho-Akt expression. Collagen type I effects were abrogated by neutralizing antiCD204 and a non-selective Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Spontaneous CD204 expression of alveolar macrophages was significantly increased in patients with IPF. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that monomeric collagen type I via CD204 induces phospho-Akt expression shifting alveolar macrophages to the profibrotic M2 type. Innate immune responses induced by collagen monomers might perpetuate pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Bleomycin induces a transient lung fibrosis in mice that has been used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our aim was to determine a sensitive method for assessing lung function in bleomycin treated mice that correlated with the degree of lung fibrosis as measured by collagen immunohistochemistry. Bleomycin (2 U/kg) or saline was intratracheally microsprayed to male C57BL/6 mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Lung function (single compartment model, constant phase model, and work of breathing) was assessed using the flexiVent system, and after euthanasia lungs were inflated with formalin in situ for histological analysis. The lung fibrosis histopathology score for the bleomycin treated animals on day 21 was indicative of mild-to-moderate fibrosis (Saline treated control: 0 ± 0, Bleomycin treated: 4.9 ± 0.4). There were at least three large areas of fibrosis in the peribronchial alveolar regions of the lung, but less than 50{\%} of each lung was affected by fibrosis. Although changes in lung function were less obvious, volume normalized dynamic work of breathing measured at 30 ml/kg tidal volume (Saline treated control: 9.2 ± 0.1 J/l, Bleomycin treated: 10.6 ± 0.3 J/l) and the oscillatory mechanics constant phase model parameter tissue elastance (H; Saline treated control: 31 ± 2 cm H2O/ml, Bleomycin treated: 38 ± 3 cm H2O/ml) were significantly increased on day 21. The work of breathing (r = 0.83) correlated slightly better with fibrosis histopathology score than H (r = 0.64). Work of breathing can detect decrements in lung function due to pulmonary fibrosis, correlates well with the amount of collagen in the lungs, and may be a more sensitive quantitative measure of efficacy for drugs being developed to treat pulmonary fibrosis. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania, revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. The CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.},

abstract = {Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive loss of the alveolar integrity, recruitment, and activation of myofibroblast, and excessive collagen deposition that resulted in loss of parenchymal architecture and lung function. Although etiology is unknown, major risk factor of disease development is represented by cigarette smoke or exposure to dust. Aims: Aim of this proteomic study was to compare broncho alveolar lavage fluid protein profiles of IPF patients, never-smoker healthy control (nonsmoker control) and smoker control subjects in order to investigate proteins potentially related to disease progression and pathogenesis. Methods: Broncho alveolar lavage fluid samples were resolved using 2D-PAGE and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by MS. The performed PCA statistically proved the correlation existing between differentially expressed spots in the three groups. Functional analysis of the identified proteins was performed by pathway and enrichment analysis by MetaCore and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Results: Interestingly, transcriptional factors NF-kB, PPARgamma, and c-myc emerged as well as a group of functional hubs. Enrichment analysis suggested that Gene Ontology (GO) process networks and pathway maps involved in IPF included angiotensin system maturation, renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, heme metabolism, coagulation system, response to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and iron transport. Conclusion: In conclusion, the combination of proteomic data with system biology platforms allowed us to amplify the information obtained processing the results and indicated the principal pathways involved. These information can point to potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets opening the way for further analysis.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4{\%} and 83.4+8{\%} in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value {\textgreater}0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value {\textgreater}0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value {\textgreater}0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value {\textgreater}0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The ex vivo finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value {\textgreater}0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Invasive aspergillosis is a worldwide disease that primarily affects immune-compromised patients, agricultural workers with corneal abrasions, individuals with structural lung disease, and patients with primary immune deficiency. The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets. The strength and efficacy of the host response is shaped by the tissue microenvironment. In preclinical models of disease, host immune augmentation strategies have yielded benefits, yet translating these insights into therapeutic strategies in humans remains challenging. SUMMARY Although advances in early diagnostic strategies and in antifungal drugs have ameliorated clinical outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, further improvements depend on gaining deeper insight into and translating advances in anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

abstract = {SignificanceListeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen responsible for listeriosis, a foodborne disease characterized by septicemia and abortion in pregnant women. The most severe listeriosis outbreaks are associated with a subset of bacterial epidemic clones, although the underlying virulence mechanisms of these clones remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that these epidemic strains secrete a bacteriocin specifically in the gut and alter host intestinal microbiota, allowing L. monocytogenes colonization of the intestine and, consequently, invasion of deeper organs. Therefore, our work shows that epidemic listeriosis implicates not only interactions between L. monocytogenes and host cells, but also interactions between L. monocytogenes and the host intestinal microbiota that are critical for the establishment of infection. Listeria monocytogenes is responsible for gastroenteritis in healthy individuals and for a severe invasive disease in immunocompromised patients. Among the three identified L. monocytogenes evolutionary lineages, lineage I strains are overrepresented in epidemic listeriosis outbreaks, but the mechanisms underlying the higher virulence potential of strains of this lineage remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Listeriolysin S (LLS), a virulence factor only present in a subset of lineage I strains, is a bacteriocin highly expressed in the intestine of orally infected mice that alters the host intestinal microbiota and promotes intestinal colonization by L. monocytogenes, as well as deeper organ infection. To our knowledge, these results therefore identify LLS as the first bacteriocin described in L. monocytogenes and associate modulation of host microbiota by L. monocytogenes epidemic strains to increased virulence.},

abstract = {IL-1 is an important mediator of inflammation and tissue damage in multiple organs, both in experimental animal models of disease and in human diseases. The IL-1 family consists of two agonists, IL-1{\$}\alpha{\$} and IL-1{\$}\beta{\$}, two receptors, biologically active IL-1RI and inert IL-1RII, and a specific receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. The balance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra in local tissues plays an important role in the susceptibility to and severity of many diseases. An allelic polymorphism in the IL-1Ra gene has been associated with a variety of human diseases primarily of epithelial and endothelial cell origin. This association may be secondary to an imbalance in the IL-1 system with enhanced production of IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} and reduced production of the major intracellular isoform of IL-1Ra. Treatment of RA with daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant IL-1Ra protein has been shown to be efficacious. Gene therapy approaches with IL-1Ra are being evaluated for the treatment of RA and other human diseases. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intratracheal instillation (IT) of bleomycin is a widely used experimental model for lung fibrosis. In this study we describe the time-course of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice using computer-assisted morphometry. C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a single IT dose of bleomycin or control saline. Animals were killed 3, 6, 14 and 21 days post-IT. Lung injury was evaluated by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, hydroxyproline concentration in the lung, routine light microscopic examination resulting in a semiquantitative morphological index (SMI) of lung injury, and quantitative morphological measurements (fibrosis fraction and alveolar wall area fraction) aided by optimas image analysis software. Changes in BAL fluid attributed to bleomycin treatment include increased total cell count (days 14 and 21), and increased percentage of neutrophils (days 3 and 6) followed by a sustained increase in lymphocytes (days 6, 14 and 21). Hydroxyproline levels increased in bleomycin-treated mice on days 14 and 21. Median SMI grades were significantly elevated on days 3, 14 and 21. Computer-assisted morphometry demonstrated a 3-fold increase in fibrosis fraction and a 1.3-fold increase in wall area fraction in bleomycin-treated mice on day 14, with no further increase on day 21. These data also demonstrate that the most suitable time point for assessing lung fibrosis in this model is 14 days after IT instillation of bleomycin, based on the observation that at 14 days the animals developed extensive fibrosis, but had less variability in the fibrotic response and lower mortality than later at 21 days. Computer-assisted morphometry provides objective and quantitative measurements that are a useful tool for the evaluation of bleomycin-induced lung injury.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 the American Physiological Society Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal disease that involves the remodeling of the distal airspace and the lung parenchyma, which results in compromised gas exchange. The median survival time once diagnosed is less than three years. Interleukin (IL)-13 has been shown to play a role in a number of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. IL-13 modulates its effector functions via a complex receptor system that includes the IL-4 receptor (R) $\alpha$, IL-13R$\alpha$1, and the IL-13R$\alpha$2. IL-13R$\alpha$1 binds IL-13 with low affinity, yet, when it forms a complex with IL-4$\alpha$, it binds with much higher affinity, inducing the effector functions of IL-13. IL-13R$\alpha$2 binds IL-13 with high affinity but has a short cytoplasmic tail and has been shown to act as a nonsignaling decoy receptor. Transfection of fibroblasts and epithelial cells with IL- 13R$\alpha$2 inhibited the IL-13 induction of soluble collagen, TGF-$\alpha$, and CCL 17. Adenoviral overexpression of IL-13R$\alpha$2 in the lung reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Our work shows that overexpression of IL-13R$\alpha$2 inhibits the IL-13 induction of fibrotic markers in vitro and inhibits bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In summary our study highlights the antifibrotic nature of IL-13Ra2.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-13 is a major inducer of fibrosis in many chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. In studies of the mechanisms underlying such induction, we found that IL-13 induces transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 in macrophages through a two-stage process involving, first, the induction of a receptor formerly considered to function only as a decoy receptor, IL-13R2. Such induction requires IL-13 (or IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. Second, it involves IL-13 signaling through IL-13R2 to activate an AP-1 variant containing c-jun and Fra-2, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter. In vivo, we found that prevention of IL-13R2 expression reduced production of TGF-1 in oxazolone-induced colitis and that prevention of IL-13R2 expression, Il13ra2 gene silencing or blockade of IL-13R2 signaling led to marked downregulation of TGF-1 production and collagen deposition in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. These data suggest that IL-13R2 signaling during prolonged inflammation is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of TGF-1–mediated fibrosis.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Both interferon-gamma-producing type 1 T helper (Th1)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells have been proposed to be involved in anti-fungal host defence. Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses.},

A range of biotherapeutics are currently synthesized using cell culture methods in large scale manufacturing facilities that produce products for both commercial use and clinical studies. The robust implementation of this technology requires optimization of a number of variables, including (1) cell lines capable of synthesizing the required molecules at high productivities that ensure low operating cost; (2) culture media and bioreactor culture conditions that achieve both the requisite productivity and meet product quality specifications; (3) appropriate on-line and off-line sensors capable of providing information that enhances process control; and (4) good understanding of culture performance at different scales to ensure smooth scale-up. Successful implementation also requires appropriate strategies for process development, scale-up and process characterization and validation that enable robust operation and ensure compliance with current regulations. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the art technology in key aspects of cell culture, e.g., generation of highly productive cell lines and optimization of cell culture process conditions.

Although -CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes (CCR2⁺Mo) and their derivatives initiate adaptive pulmonary immune responses, their role in coordinating innate immune responses in the lung remain poorly defined. Using conditional and antibody-mediated cell ablation strategies, we found that CCR2⁺Mo and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) are essential for innate defense against inhaled conidia. By harnessing fluorescent Aspergillus reporter (FLARE) conidia that report fungal cell association and viability in vivo, we identify two mechanisms by which CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs exert innate antifungal activity. First, CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs condition the lung inflammatory milieu to augment neutrophil conidiacidal activity. Second, conidial uptake by CCR2⁺Mo temporally coincided with their differentiation into Mo-DCs, a process that resulted in direct conidial killing. Our findings illustrate both indirect and direct functions for CCR2⁺Mo and their derivatives in innate antifungal immunity in the lung.},

abstract = {Numerous gene signatures, or modules have been described to evaluate the immune cell composition in transcriptomes of multicellular tissue samples. However, significant diversity in module gene content for specific cell types is associated with heterogeneity in their perfor-mance. In order to rank modules that best reflect their purported association, we have gen-erated the modular discrimination index (MDI) score that assesses expression of each module in the target cell type relative to other cells. We demonstrate that MDI scores predict modules that best reflect independently validated differences in cellular composition, and correlate with the covariance between cell numbers and module expression in human blood and tissue samples. Our analyses demonstrate that MDI scores provide an ordinal summary statistic that reliably ranks the accuracy of gene expression modules for deconvolution of cell type abundance in transcriptional data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Th e outcomes of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) who undergo hospitalization have not been well characterized. We sought to determine the frequency of all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations and to evaluate their impact on the subsequent course and survival of patients with IPF. METHODS: The records of patients with IPF evaluated at a tertiary center were examined for the cause and duration of hospitalization. Data on subsequent patient outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Th e IPF cohort consisted of 592 patients, 25.3{\%} of whom were hospitalized subse-quent to their IPF diagnosis. A respiratory-related cause accounted for 77.3{\%} of these hospi-talizations. Th e median transplant-free survival for all patients was 23.3 months (interquartile range [IQR], 7.6-63.6 months) from the time of consultation. Transplant-free survival aft er hospital admission was much lower for patients with a respiratory hospitalization com-pared with those with a nonrespiratory hospitalization (median survival, 2.8 months [IQR, 0.63-16.2 months] vs 27.7 months [IQR, 7.4-59.6 months]; P 5 .0004). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that both all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations were strongly asso-ciated with mortality aft er adjusting for baseline demographics. Among patients with a respi-ratory hospitalization, 22.4{\%} died while in the hospital, whereas 16.4{\%} eventually went on to lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations are common events in patients with IPF. Most hospitaliza-tions are respiratory-related and are associated with high in-hospital mortality and limited survival beyond discharge. Both all-cause and respiratory hospitalizations are associated with mortality, and therefore, either could be used as an end point in IPF clinical trials.},

abstract = {A significant component of immune biology research is the investigation of protein encoding genes that play central roles in contributing inflammatory response. A gel-free quantitative bottom-up proteomics study was performed on immune cell macrophages after the combined treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and statin drugs using mass spectrometry and a detailed bioinformatics analyses were conducted. Systematic bioinformatics analysis was applied for discovering novel relationships among proteins and effects of statin and lipopolysaccharide in macrophage cells. Based on gene ontology, majority of protein encoding genes was involved in metabolic and cellular processes and are actively associated with binding, structural molecular, and catalytic activity. Notably, proteomic data analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), discovered the plectin and prohibitin 2 protein interactions network and inflammatory-disease based protein networks. Two up-regulated proteins, plectin and prohibitin 2, were further validated by immunoblotting. Plectin was also cross-validated by immunocytochemistry, since its expression was highly modulated by statin but inhibited during LPS-stimulation. Collectively, the significant up-regulation of plectin due to the treatment of statin, suggests that statin has a significant impact on the cytoskeletal networks of cells. Plectin might have a significant role in the intermediate filament assembly and dynamics, and possibly stabilizing and crosslinking intermediate filament networks.},

In this work, we present Curved, a large-surface interaction device, whose shape is designed based on the natural movement of an outstretched arm. It is able to track one or two hands above or on its surface by using 32 capacitive proximity sensors. Supporting both touch and mid-air interaction can enable more versatile modes of use. We use image processing methods for tracking the user's hands and classify gestures based on their motion. Virtual reality is a potential use case for such interaction systems and was chosen for our demonstration application. We conducted a study with ten users to test the gesture tracking performance, as well as user experience and user preference for the adjustable system parameters.},

The balance between Th1, Th17, and FoxP3 + CD4 + T cell subsets in sarcoidosis remains unclear. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells, from 30 patients with sarcoidosis, 18 patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, and 15 healthy controls, were investigated with flow cytometry for intracellular expression of FoxP3. In a subset of the patients, expression of the cytokines IL17A and IFN- ? was investigated. The fractions of FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells and Th17 cells were both lower in sarcoidosis compared to controls ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.011 , resp.). The proportion of Th17 cells positive for IFN- ? was greater in sarcoidosis than controls (median 72.4{\%} versus 31{\%}, P = 0.0005 ) and increased with radiologic stage ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.45 , and P = 0.03 ). IFN- ? + Th17 cells were highly correlated with Th1 cells ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.64 , and P = 0.001 ), and the ratio of IFN- ? + Th17/FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells was prominently increased in sarcoidosis. IFN- ? + Th17 cells may represent a pathogenic subset of Th17 cells, yet their expression of IFN- ? could be a consequence of a Th1-polarized cytokine milieu. Our results indicate a possible immune cell imbalance in sarcoidosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The analysis of lung artefacts has gained increasing importance as markers of lung pathology. B-line artefact (BLA), caused by a reverberation phenomenon, is the most important lung artefact. In this review, we discuss the current role of BLA in pneumology and explore open questions of the published consensus. METHODS We summarized current literature about BLA. Also, we presented observations on healthy subjects and patients with interstitial syndrome (pulmonary fibrosis and edema), to investigate technical factors influencing BLA visualization. RESULTS BLA imaging is influenced by more factors than recently assumed. When multiple BLA is visualized in the lung, they represent a sign of increased density due to the loss of aeration in the lung periphery. This condition may indicate different diseases including cardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse or focal interstitial lung diseases (ILD), infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Correct interpretation of BLA in lung ultrasound is strongly influenced by associated sonographic signs and careful integration of all relevant clinical information. CONCLUSIONS BLA is useful to monitor clinical response, and may become crucial in directing the diagnostic process. Further research is warranted to clarify technical adjustments, different probe and machine factors that influence the visualization of BLA.},

abstract = {Following the primary mechanical impact, traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces the simultaneous production of a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory molecular mediators. Given the variety of cell types and their requisite expression of cognate receptors this creates a highly complex inflammatory milieu. Increasingly in neurotrauma research there has been an effort to define injury-induced inflammatory responses within the context of in vitro defined macrophage polarization phenotypes, known as "M1" and "M2". Herein, we expand upon our previous work in a rodent model of TBI to show that the categorization of inflammatory response cannot be so easily delineated using this nomenclature. Specifically, we show that TBI elicited a wide spectrum of concurrent expression responses within both pro- and anti-inflammatory arms. Moreover, we show that the cells principally responsible for the production of these inflammatory mediators, microglia/macrophages, simultaneously express both "M1" and "M2" phenotypic markers. Overall, these data align with recent reports suggesting that microglia/macrophages cannot adequately switch to a polarized "M1-only" or "M2-only" phenotype, but display a mixed phenotype due to the complex signaling events surrounding them.},

In recent years the long-held belief that macrophage populations in the adult are continuously replenished by monocytes from the bone marrow (BM) has been overturned with the advent of new techniques to dissect cellular ontogeny. The new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated, and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are undefined. Here, we review the emergence of these concepts and discuss current controversies and future directions in macrophage biology.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF and whether components of this signature may serve as biomarkers for disease presence and progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the concentrations of 49 proteins in the plasma of 74 patients with IPF and in the plasma of 53 control individuals. We identified a combinatorial signature of five proteins-MMP7, MMP1, MMP8, IGFBP1, and TNFRSF1A-that was sufficient to distinguish patients from controls with a sensitivity of 98.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 92.7{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 98.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 89.9{\%}-100{\%}). Increases in MMP1 and MMP7 were also observed in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from IPF patients. MMP7 and MMP1 plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis and distinguished IPF compared to subacute/chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease that may mimic IPF, with a sensitivity of 96.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 81.0{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 87.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 72.6{\%}-95.7{\%}). We verified our results in an independent validation cohort composed of patients with IPF, familial pulmonary fibrosis, subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD), as well as with control individuals. MMP7 and MMP1 concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to controls in this cohort. Furthermore, MMP7 concentrations were elevated in patients with subclinical ILD and negatively correlated with percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC{\%}) and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments provide the first evidence for a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF to our knowledge. The two main components of this signature, MMP7 and MMP1, are overexpressed in the lung microenvironment and distinguish IPF from other chronic lung diseases. Additionally, increased MMP7 concentration may be indicative of asymptomatic ILD and reflect disease progression.},

We assessed relationships between gene expression patterns, pathological features, and systemic biomarkers to identify biomarkers that reflect the aggregate disease burden in patients with IPF. METHODS: Gene expression microarrays (N=40 IPF; 8 controls) and immunohistochemical analyses (N=22 IPF; 8 controls) of lung biopsies. Clinical characterisation and blood biomarker levels of MMP3 and CXCL13 in a separate cohort of patients with IPF (N=80). RESULTS: 2940 genes were significantly differentially expressed between IPF and control samples (|fold change| {\textgreater}1.5, p{\textless}0.05). Two clusters of co-regulated genes related to bronchiolar epithelium or lymphoid aggregates exhibited substantial heterogeneity within the IPF population. Gene expression in bronchiolar and lymphoid clusters corresponded to the extent of bronchiolisation and lymphoid aggregates determined by immunohistochemistry in adjacent tissue sections. Elevated serum levels of MMP3, encoded in the bronchiolar cluster, and CXCL13, encoded in the lymphoid cluster, corresponded to disease severity and shortened survival time (p{\textless}10(-7) for MMP3 and p{\textless}10(-5) for CXCL13; Cox proportional hazards model). CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic pathological heterogeneity in IPF lung tissue corresponds to specific gene expression patterns related to bronchiolisation and lymphoid aggregates. MMP3 and CXCL13 are systemic biomarkers that reflect the aggregate burden of these pathological features across total lung tissue. These biomarkers may have clinical utility as prognostic and/or surrogate biomarkers of disease activity in interventional studies in IPF.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

TaqMan is a registered trademark of Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. We observed high correlation between quantitative gene expression values and microarray platform results and found few discordant measurements among all platforms. The main cause of variability was differences in probe sequence and thus target location. A second source of variability was the limited and variable sensitivity of the different microarray platforms for detecting weakly expressed genes, which affected interplatform and intersite reproducibility of differentially expressed genes. From this analysis, we conclude that the MAQC microarray data set has been validated by alternative quantitative gene expression platforms thus supporting the use of microarray platforms for the quantitative characterization of gene expression.},

Here we present a methodology enabling integration of information about TCR specificity with information about T cell function. This method involves sequencing of TCR$\alpha$ and TCR$\beta$ genes, and amplifying functional genes characteristic of different T cell subsets, in single T cells. Because this approach retains information about individual TCR$\alpha$-TCR$\beta$ pairs, TCRs of interest can be expressed and used in functional studies, for antigen discovery, or in therapeutic applications. We apply this approach to study the clonal ancestry and differentiation of T lymphocytes infiltrating a human colorectal carcinoma.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

abstract = {Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and inter-connectivity of com- puter technology is creating unprecedented quantities of digital data. Data mining, the science of extracting useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as a young and interdisciplinary field in computer science. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, en- gineering and government, and it is widely believed that data mining will have profound impact on our society. The growing consensus that data mining can bring real value has led to an explosion in demand for novel data mining technologies and for students who are trained in data mining—students who have an understanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to real-life problems, and are trained for research and development of new data mining methods. Courses in data mining have started to sprawl all over the world. Based on this development of the field, the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee has set up the ACM SIGKDD Curriculum Committee to design a sample curriculum for data mining that gives recommendations for educating the next generation of students in data mining. Based on feedback from researchers, educators, and students, we are convinced that it is an important task to have a carefully designed, conceptually strong, technically rich, and balanced curriculum for this discipline. A comprehensive and balanced curriculum will ensure that the education in data mining sets a solid foundation for the healthy growth of the field, and it will promote systematic training of students in computer science, information sciences, and other related fields, and it will provide guidance for the training of the next generation of data mining researchers, developers and technology users. The Curriculum Committee is composed of university professors and researchers who have actively con- tributed to data mining research and education, researchers and practitioners from industry who have rich experiences in applying data mining technology, and administrators from government agencies. This report is the first draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Committee. We expect that this draft will be extensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forward to suggestions and recommendations from the Committee and from the general data mining research, development, and application community. The remainder of this report is structured as follows. First, we outline the principles that guided us in the selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief description of the prerequisites that we assume students of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Section 4 contains the core of this document, our curriculum proposal},

abstract = {Intratracheal instillation (IT) of bleomycin is a widely used experimental model for lung fibrosis. In this study we describe the time-course of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice using computer-assisted morphometry. C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a single IT dose of bleomycin or control saline. Animals were killed 3, 6, 14 and 21 days post-IT. Lung injury was evaluated by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, hydroxyproline concentration in the lung, routine light microscopic examination resulting in a semiquantitative morphological index (SMI) of lung injury, and quantitative morphological measurements (fibrosis fraction and alveolar wall area fraction) aided by optimas image analysis software. Changes in BAL fluid attributed to bleomycin treatment include increased total cell count (days 14 and 21), and increased percentage of neutrophils (days 3 and 6) followed by a sustained increase in lymphocytes (days 6, 14 and 21). Hydroxyproline levels increased in bleomycin-treated mice on days 14 and 21. Median SMI grades were significantly elevated on days 3, 14 and 21. Computer-assisted morphometry demonstrated a 3-fold increase in fibrosis fraction and a 1.3-fold increase in wall area fraction in bleomycin-treated mice on day 14, with no further increase on day 21. These data also demonstrate that the most suitable time point for assessing lung fibrosis in this model is 14 days after IT instillation of bleomycin, based on the observation that at 14 days the animals developed extensive fibrosis, but had less variability in the fibrotic response and lower mortality than later at 21 days. Computer-assisted morphometry provides objective and quantitative measurements that are a useful tool for the evaluation of bleomycin-induced lung injury.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is a common cause of invasive and allergic pulmonary disease. Resting conidia of the filamentous fungus are constantly inhaled, but cause infection only after initiating hyphal growth. In this study, we have explored whether macrophages can distinguish between resting spores and the maturing, potentially invasive form of the fungus. Although macrophages bind and ingest A. fumigatus resting conidia efficiently, there is little inflammatory response; NF-kappabeta is not activated, inflammatory cytokines are not induced, and reactive oxygen species are not produced. However, maturing A. fumigatus conidia and germ tubes stimulate NF-kappabeta, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and production of reactive oxygen by human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophages from multiple anatomical sites. These responses are in part mediated by dectin-1, which binds cell wall beta-glucan that is not present on the surface of dormant conidia, but is present after cellular swelling and loss of the hydrophobic proteinaceous cell wall. Dectin-1 binding to germ tubes augments, but is not required for, TLR2-mediated inflammatory cytokine secretion. Dectin-1 recognition of germ tubes also stimulates TNF-alpha production in the absence of both TLR2 and MyD88 signaling. These data demonstrate one mechanism by which the pulmonary inflammatory response is tailored toward metabolically active cells, thereby avoiding unnecessary tissue damage with frequent inhalation of ubiquitous spores.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

Hence, defining glycolysis as proinflammatory and FAO as anti-inflammatory may be an oversimplification. Here we review how the rapid growth of the immunometabolism field has improved our understanding of macrophage activation and at the same time has led to an increase in the appearance of contradictory observations.

abstract = {Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in proteins has been critical to the understanding of protein dynamics and enzyme reactions using tryptophan as a molecular optical probe. We report here our systematic examinations of potential quenching residues with more than 40 proteins. With site-directed mutation, we placed tryptophan to desired positions or altered its neighboring residues to screen quenching groups among 20 amino acid residues and of peptide backbones. With femtosecond resolution, we observed the ultrafast quenching dynamics within 100 ps and identified two ultrafast quenching groups, the carbonyl- and sulfur-containing residues. The former is glutamine and glutamate residues and the later is disulfide bond and cysteine residue. The quenching by the peptide-bond carbonyl group as well as other potential residues mostly occurs in longer than 100 ps. These ultrafast quenching dynamics occur at van der Waals distances through intraprotein electron transfer with high directionality. Following optimal molecular orbital overlap, electron jumps from the benzene ring of the indole moiety in a vertical orientation to the LUMO of acceptor quenching residues. Molecular dynamics simulations were invoked to elucidate various correlations of quenching dynamics with separation distances, relative orientations, local fluctuations and reaction heterogeneity. These unique ultrafast quenching pairs, as recently found to extensively occur in high-resolution protein structures, may have significant biological implications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

IL-1ra had little or no influence on the number of cells recovered from the broncho-alveolar lavage. Study of histological sections suggests that IL-1ra globally decreased the proportion of damaged lung and particularly in silica the formation of nodules with a rich content in collagen fibrils. IL-1ra was also effective in reducing the lung hydroxyproline content when given on day 25 after instillation of bleomycin or silica, indicating that it may reverse established PF.

abstract = {The understanding of how cellular productivity is modulated in cell lines is of significant importance in the biopharmaceutical industry. Often, single molecular mechanisms fail to fully explain how specific antibody productivity is enhanced during proliferation arrest. Previously, we reported that certain physiological changes occur when proliferation is arrested by p21(CIP1) over expression. In this work, we correlate physiological and molecular factors to enhance antibody productivity. Using biomass, cell volume and total cellular protein content as a basis for determining specific productivity, it was found that total cellular protein correlated best with cellular productivity. This meant that there was no preferential increase in antibody production relative to cellular proteins in arrested cultures. However, molecular analysis of mRNA transcription and stability indicated that both processes were altered in arrested cultures resulting in up to threefold increased heavy chain mRNA levels. While flow cytometric analysis revealed that arrested cells had elevated translational capacity for both heavy and light chains, the heavy to light chain polypeptide ratio was 10-50{\%} higher than in the control. This resulted in a lower extracellular accumulation of light chains and a better utilization of cellular resources for the formation of complete antibodies. Active transcriptional regulation of heavy and light chain mRNA and the modulation of translational activities play a vital role in the modulation of overall antibody productivity of these cells. The combined effect of heavy chain mRNA enhancement and the increased cellular assembly capacity was determined to effectively increase specific productivity.},

Thus, chemokine receptors/chemokines contribute not only to inflammatory and immune responses in the lung but also play a critical role in the regulation of lung tissue repair, regeneration, and remodeling. This review aims to summarize current state-of-the-art on chemokine receptors and their ligands in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma/allergy, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, and lung infection. Furthermore, the therapeutic opportunities of chemokine receptors in aforementioned lung diseases are discussed.

abstract = {Fibrosis or scarring of diverse organs and tissues is considered as a pathologic consequence of a chronically altered wound healing response which is tightly linked to inflammation and angiogenesis. The recruitment of immune cells, local proliferation of fibroblasts and the consecutive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins are common pathophysiological hallmarks of tissue fibrosis, irrespective of the organ involved. Chemokines, a family of chemotactic cytokines, appear to be central mediators of the initiation as well as progression of these biological processes. Traditionally chemokines have only been considered to play a critical role in orchestrating the influx of immune cells to sites of tissue injury. However, within the last years, further aspects of chemokine biology including fibroblast activation and angiogenesis have been deciphered in tissue fibrosis of many different organs. Interestingly, certain chemokines appear to mediate common effects in liver, kidney, lung, and skin of various animal models, while others mediate tissue specific effects. These aspects have to be kept in mind when extrapolating data of animal studies to early human trials. Nevertheless, the further understanding of chemokine effects in tissue fibrosis might be an attractive approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets in chronic organ damage associated with high morbidity and mortality.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease defined by the presence of nonnecrotizing granuloma in the absence of any known cause. Although clinically, the heterogeneity of sarcoidosis is well characterized, the transcriptome of the sarcoidosis and underlying molecular mechanisms are not. The signal of all transcripts, small and long noncoding RNAs, can be detected using microarrays or RNA-Sequencing. Analyzing the transcriptome of tissues that are directly affected by granulomas is of great importance to understand biology of the disease and may be predictive of disease and treatment outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple genome wide expression studies performed on sarcoidosis affected tissues were published in the last 11 years. Published studies focused to examine differences in gene expression levels between sarcoidosis vs. control tissues, stable vs. progressive form of sarcoidosis, as well as sarcoidosis vs. other diseases. Strikingly, all these transcriptomics data confirm the key role of TH1 immune response in sarcoidosis and particularly of interferon-{\$}\gamma{\$} (IFN-{\$}\gamma{\$}) and type I IFN-driven signaling pathways. SUMMARY First steps toward transcriptomics of sarcoidosis in precision medicine are taken and highlight the potentials of this approach. Large prospective follow-up studies are required to identify signatures predictive of disease progression and outcome.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

The microenvironment of the airway lumen has a considerable influence on many aspects of alveolar macrophage phenotype, function and turnover. As the lungs adapt to environmental challenges, so too do alveolar macrophages adapt to accommodate the ever-changing needs of the tissue. In this Review, we discuss the unique characteristics of alveolar macrophages, the mechanisms that drive their adaptation and the direct and indirect influences of epithelial cells on them. We also highlight how airway luminal macrophages function as sentinels of a healthy state and how they do not respond in a pro-inflammatory manner to antigens that do not disrupt lung structure. The unique tissue location and function of alveolar macrophages distinguish them from other macrophage populations and suggest that it is important to classify macrophages according to the site that they occupy.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater}25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

They may be polarized according to various stimuli, which subsequently subdivide them into distinct populations. Macrophages with inflammatory activity function mainly during pathological context, while those with regulatory activity control inflammation and also remodel the repairing process. Here, we propose to review and to present a concise discuss on the role of different components during tissue repair, including those related to innate immune receptors and metabolic modifications. The scar formation is directly related to the degree of inflammation, but also with the appearance of M2 macrophages. In spite of greater numbers of macrophages in the fibrotic phase, regulatory macrophages present some characteristics related to promotion of fibrosis but also with the control of scar formation. These regulatory macrophages present an oxidative metabolism, and differ from the initial inflammatory macrophages, which in turn, present a glycolytic characteristic, which allow regulatory ones to optimize the oxygen consumption and minimizing their ROS production. We will emphasize the difference in macrophage subpopulations and the origin and plasticity of these cells during fibrotic processes.},

abstract = {Fibrosis or scarring of diverse organs and tissues is considered as a pathologic consequence of a chronically altered wound healing response which is tightly linked to inflammation and angiogenesis. The recruitment of immune cells, local proliferation of fibroblasts and the consecutive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins are common pathophysiological hallmarks of tissue fibrosis, irrespective of the organ involved. Chemokines, a family of chemotactic cytokines, appear to be central mediators of the initiation as well as progression of these biological processes. Traditionally chemokines have only been considered to play a critical role in orchestrating the influx of immune cells to sites of tissue injury. However, within the last years, further aspects of chemokine biology including fibroblast activation and angiogenesis have been deciphered in tissue fibrosis of many different organs. Interestingly, certain chemokines appear to mediate common effects in liver, kidney, lung, and skin of various animal models, while others mediate tissue specific effects. These aspects have to be kept in mind when extrapolating data of animal studies to early human trials. Nevertheless, the further understanding of chemokine effects in tissue fibrosis might be an attractive approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets in chronic organ damage associated with high morbidity and mortality.

abstract = {Few studies have addressed the importance of vascular remodeling in the lung during the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. For fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix to occur, there must be a geometric increase in neovascularization. We hypothesized that net angiogenesis during the pathogenesis of fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis are dependent in part upon an overexpression of the angiogenic CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). To test this hypothesis, we measured MIP-2 by specific ELISA in whole lung homogenates in either bleomycin-treated or control CBA/J mice and correlated these levels with lung hydroxyproline. We found that lung tissue from mice treated with bleomycin, compared with that from saline-treated controls, demonstrated a significant increase in the presence of MIP-2 that was correlated to a greater angiogenic response and total lung hydroxyproline content. Neutralizing anti-MIP-2 Abs inhibited the angiogenic activity of day 16 bleomycin-treated lung specimens using an in vivo angiogenesis bioassay. Furthermore, when MIP-2 was depleted in vivo by passive immunization, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced without a change in the presence of pulmonary neutrophils, fibroblast proliferation, or collagen gene expression. This was also paralleled by a reduction in angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that the angiogenic CXC chemokine, MIP-2, is an important factor that regulates angiogenesis/fibrosis in pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless}0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), particularly polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Despite the attempts to establish a link between them, the shared biological mechanisms are yet to be characterized. An integrated gene expression meta-analysis of five independent publicly available microarray data of the three diseases was conducted to identify shared gene expression signatures and overlapping biological processes. Using INMEX bioinformatic tool, based on combined Effect Size (ES) approaches, we identified a total of 1,157 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (697 overexpressed and 460 underexpressed genes) shared between the three diseases. EnrichR tool's rich library was used for comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis which revealed “mRNA Splicing” and “SUMO E3 ligases SUMOylate target proteins” among the most enriched terms. Network based meta- analysis identified MYC and FN1 to be the most highly ranked hub genes. Our results reveal that the alterations in biomarkers of the coagulation cascade like F2R, PROS1, SELPLG and ITGB2 were common between the three diseases. Interestingly, the study has generated a novel database of candidate genetic markers, pathways and transcription factors shared between thrombosis and MPDs, which might aid in the development of prognostic therapeutic biomarkers.

abstract = {Background: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem immuno-inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that most commonly involves the lungs. We hypothesized that an unbiased approach to identify pathways activated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells can shed light on the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Methods: We recruited 15 patients with various stages of sarcoidosis and 12 healthy controls. All subjects underwent bronchoscopy with lavage. For each subject, total RNA was extracted from BAL cells and hybridized to an Affymetrix U133A microarray. Rigorous statistical methods were applied to identify differential gene expression between subjects with sarcoidosis vs. controls. To better elucidate pathways differentially activated between these groups, we integrated network and gene set enrichment analyses of BAL cell transcriptional profiles. Results: Sarcoidosis patients were either non-smokers or former smokers, all had lung involvement and only two were on systemic prednisone. Healthy controls were all non-smokers. Comparison of BAL cell gene expression between sarcoidosis and healthy subjects revealed over 1500 differentially expressed genes. Several previously described immune mediators, such as interferon gamma, were upregulated in the sarcoidosis subjects. Using an integrative computational approach we constructed a modular network of over 80 gene sets that were highly enriched in patients with sarcoidosis. Many of these pathways mapped to inflammatory and immune-related processes including adaptive immunity, T-cell signaling, graft vs. host disease, interleukin 12, 23 and 17 signaling. Additionally, we uncovered a close association between the proteasome machinery and adaptive immunity, highlighting a potentially important and targetable relationship in the pathobiology of sarcoidosis. Conclusions: BAL cells in sarcoidosis are characterized by enrichment of distinct transcriptional programs involved in immunity and proteasomal processes. Our findings add to the growing evidence implicating alveolar resident immune effector cells in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and identify specific pathways whose activation may modulate disease progression.},

abstract = {Organ fibrosis, the result of exaggerated, persistent, and often irreversible accumulation of extracellular matrix, complicates numerous diseases in all organs and tissues and has particularly serious consequences in the lungs. Abnormally accumulating scar tissue both replaces normally functioning parenchyma and distorts the architecture of unaffected tissue. In the lungs, the fibrotic process often leads to rapid and severe abnormalities in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange properties. There is no confirmed cure, and better therapies are required for treating fibrosis. The development of therapeutic strategies compels a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis, which are diverse, complex, and redundant. Epithelial injury, oxidative stress, coagulation disturbances, and inflammation are engaged in a complex interplay leading to augmented transformation of several cell types into myofibroblasts and prolonged survival of these extracellular matrix-producing cells. Cytokines are centrally engaged in the homeostatic and pathophysiologic regulation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it appears that identical cytokines are utilized by inflammation, profibrotic mechanisms, and the fibrotic process itself, suggesting that specific targeting or utilization of these cytokines holds therapeutic promise. In this article, we review the wealth of recent knowledge on major cytokines involved in the fibrotic process.},

abstract = {Hundreds of clinical studies have demonstrated associations between the human microbiome and disease, yet fundamental questions remain on how we can generalize this knowledge. Results from individual studies can be inconsistent, and comparing published data is further complicated by a lack of standard processing and analysis methods. Here we introduce the MicrobiomeHD database, which includes 28 published case–control gut microbiome studies spanning ten diseases. We perform a cross-disease meta-analysis of these studies using standardized methods. We find consistent patterns characterizing disease-associated microbiome changes. Some diseases are associated with over 50 genera, while most show only 10–15 genus-level changes. Some diseases are marked by the presence of potentially pathogenic microbes, whereas others are characterized by a depletion of health-associated bacteria. Furthermore, we show that about half of genera associated with individual studies are bacteria that respond to more than one disease. Thus, many associations found in case–control studies are likely not disease-specific but rather part of a non-specific, shared response to health and disease.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive inflammatory disease with limited therapeutic options. To better understand the inflammatory responses that precede and concur with collagen deposition, we used three models of pulmonary fibrosis and identify a critical mechanistic role for IL-17A. After exposure to bleomycin (BLM), but not Schistosoma mansoni eggs, IL-17A produced by CD4(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells induced significant neutrophilia and pulmonary fibrosis. Studies conducted with C57BL/6 il17a(-/-) mice confirmed an essential role for IL-17A. Mechanistically, using ifngamma(-/-), il10(-/-), il10(-/-)il12p40(-/-), and il10(-/-)il17a(-/-) mice and TGF-beta blockade, we demonstrate that IL-17A-driven fibrosis is suppressed by IL-10 and facilitated by IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40. BLM-induced IL-17A production was also TGF-beta dependent, and recombinant IL-17A-mediated fibrosis required TGF-beta, suggesting cooperative roles for IL-17A and TGF-beta in the development of fibrosis. Finally, we show that fibrosis induced by IL-1beta, which mimics BLM-induced fibrosis, is also highly dependent on IL-17A. IL-17A and IL-1beta were also increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with IPF. Together, these studies identify a critical role for IL-17A in fibrosis, illustrating the potential utility of targeting IL-17A in the treatment of drug and inflammation-induced fibrosis.},

Functional analysis of these genes did not indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal restrictive respiratory disease under the idiopathic lung disease (ILD) class. IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and has more scarring, less inflammation, and poorer prognosis than most other ILD forms. Exacerbation of IPF is rapid, with unpredictable deterio- ration of lung function, and is associated with short-term mortality. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF reports that the incidence of acute exacerbations is between 5{\%}-10{\%}. Limited real-world evidence has been identified in the United States that assesses patterns of hospitalization, exacerbation of IPF, and the associated economic burden. OBJECTIVES: To (a) characterize patients newly diagnosed with IPF and (b) examine incidence rates and costs of all-cause hospitalizations, IPF-related hospitalizations, and exacerbations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with a national com- mercial claims database from calendar years 2006 to 2011. Newly diag- nosed IPF patients were identified with either ≥ 2 claims for idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (IFA) or ≥ 1 claim for IFA and ≥ 1 claim for postinflam- matory pulmonary fibrosis and a lung biopsy or thoracic high-resolution computed tomography within 90 days of the first claim for IFA (index date). IPF-related hospitalizations and possible IPF exacerbations were defined based on diagnoses recorded on event claims. Frequency, incidence rate, duration of events, and associated costs from the third-party payer's per- spective were estimated. RESULTS: Among 1,735 identified IPF patients, 38.6{\%} had at least 1 all-cause hospitalization; 10.8{\%} had IPF-related hospitalizations; 4.6{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to hospitalization; and 72.1{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to urgent outpatient visits dur- ing the 1-year post-index period. Incident rates for these 4 events were 83 (95{\%} CI = 79-88), 17 (95{\%} CI = 14-19), 7 (95{\%} CI = 6-9), and 277 (95{\%} CI = 269-286) per 100 person-years, respectively. Average costs per event were {\$}13,987 (SD = {\$}41,988), {\$}16,812 (SD = {\$}66,399), {\$}14,731 (SD = {\$}85,468), and {\$}444 (SD = {\$}1,481), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and possible exacerbations among patients with IPF were costly. Appropriate management of IPF needs to be consid- ered to help slow IPF disease progression. J},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening, interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. The median survival of patients with IPF is only 2 to 3 years, yet some patients live much longer. Respiratory failure resulting from disease progression is the most frequent cause of death. To date we have limited information as to predictors of mortality in patients with IPF, and research in this area has failed to yield prediction models that can be reliably used in clinical practice to predict individual risk of mortality. The goal of this concise clinical review is to examine and summarize the current data on the clinical course, individual predictors of survival, and proposed clinical prediction models in IPF. Finally, we will discuss challenges and future directions related to predicting survival in IPF.},

abstract = {Both interferon-gamma-producing type 1 T helper (Th1)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells have been proposed to be involved in anti-fungal host defence. Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is synthesized in the liver and in macrophages, and it has antiatherogenic properties that are mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of plasma cholesterol homeostasis. Previous data suggest that apoE also has antiinflammatory properties that may contribute to protection against atherosclerosis independent of its role in lipid metabolism. In this study, apoE knockout and C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We show that apoE modulates the systemic type I inflammatory response in vivo. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and interferon-gamma were upregulated to a significantly greater extent in apoE-deficient mice than in wild-type mice at both the mRNA and protein levels following administration of LPS. In contrast, hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein receptor/apobec-1 double knockout mice had a similar cytokine response as wild-type mice, eliminating hypercholesterolemia as a cause for the exaggerated cytokine response. Importantly, reconstitution of apoE expression in the liver of apoE-deficient mice normalized the LPS-induced plasma protein levels of IL-12p40. Furthermore, there was selective upregulation of plasma IL-12 in apoE knockout mice by a TLR3 agonist, poly I:C, but not by other TLR agonists, CpG oligonucleotide or Toxoplasma gondii antigen. This implies that apoE selectively regulates TLR4- and TLR3-mediated signaling of IL-12 production. These results indicate that apoE modulates the T helper-1-type immune response in vivo by modulating IL-12 production.},

Thus, chemokine receptors/chemokines contribute not only to inflammatory and immune responses in the lung but also play a critical role in the regulation of lung tissue repair, regeneration, and remodeling. This review aims to summarize current state-of-the-art on chemokine receptors and their ligands in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma/allergy, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, and lung infection. Furthermore, the therapeutic opportunities of chemokine receptors in aforementioned lung diseases are discussed.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered the most common and severe form of the disease, with a median survival of approximately three years and no proven effective therapy. Despite the fact that effective treatments are absent and the precise mechanisms that drive fibrosis in most patients remain incompletely understood, an extensive body of scientific literature regarding pulmonary fibrosis has accumulated over the past 35 years. In this review, we discuss three broad areas which have been explored that may be responsible for the combination of altered lung fibroblasts, loss of alveolar epithelial cells, and excessive accumulation of ECM: inflammation and immune mechanisms, oxidative stress and oxidative signaling, and procoagulant mechanisms. We discuss each of these processes separately to facilitate clarity, but certainly significant interplay will occur amongst these pathways in patients with this disease.},

We aimed to identify prognostic factors, including multidimensional indices from a significant IPF cohort at the Bristol Interstitial Lung Disease Centre in the UK. Patients diagnosed with IPF between 2007 and 2014 were identified. Longitudinal pulmonary physiology and exercise testing results were collated, with all-cause mortality used as the primary outcome. Factors influencing overall, 12- and 24-month survival were identified using Cox proportional hazards modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We found in this real-world cohort of 167 patients, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and initiation of long-term oxygen were independent markers of poor prognosis. Exercise testing results predicted 12-month mortality as well as DLCO, but did not perform as well for overall survival. The Composite Physiological Index was the best performing multidimensional index, but did not outperform DLCO. Our data confirmed that patients who experienced a fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) {\textgreater}10{\%} had significantly worse survival after that point (p=0.024). Our data from longitudinal follow-up in IPF show that DLCO is the best individual prognostic marker, outperforming FVC. Exercise testing is important in predicting early poor outcome.

abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling technology has resulted in detailed transcriptome data for a wide range of tissues, conditions and diseases. In neuroscience, expression datasets were mostly generated using whole brain tissue samples, resulting in data from a mixture of cell types, including glial cells and neurons. Over the past few years, a rapidly increasing number of expression profiling studies using isolated microglial cell populations have been reported. In these studies, the microglia transcriptome was compared to other cell types, such as other brain cells and peripheral tissue macrophages, and related to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. A commonality found in many of these studies was that microglia possess distinct gene expression signatures. This repertoire of selectively-expressed microglial genes highlight functions beyond immune responses, such as synaptic modulation and neurotrophic support, and open up avenues to explore as-yet-unexpected roles. These data provide improved understanding of disease pathology, and complement not only the aforementioned whole brain tissue transcriptome studies, but also genome- and epigenome-wide association studies. In this review, insights obtained from isolated microglia transcriptome studies are presented, and compared to studies using other genome-wide approaches. The relation of microglia to other tissue macrophages and glial cell populations, as well as the role of microglia in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative conditions, will be discussed. Many more of these types of studies are expected in the near future, hopefully leading to the identification of novel genes and targets for neurodegenerative conditions. GLIA 2015.},

OBJECTIVES To explore the host immune response and microbial interaction in IPF as they relate to progression-free survival (PFS), fibroblast function, and leukocyte phenotypes. METHODS Paired microarray gene expression data derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data from bronchoalveolar lavage obtained as part of the COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with Biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-Progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) study were used to conduct association pathway analyses. The responsiveness of paired lung fibroblasts to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulation by CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) was integrated into microbiome-gene expression association analyses for a subset of individuals. The relationship between associated pathways and circulating leukocyte phenotypes was explored by flow cytometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Down-regulation of immune response pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, Toll-, and RIG1-like receptor pathways, was associated with worse PFS. Ten of the 11 PFS-associated pathways correlated with microbial diversity and individual genus, with species accumulation curve richness as a hub. Higher species accumulation curve richness was significantly associated with inhibition of NODs and TLRs, whereas increased abundance of Streptococcus correlated with increased NOD-like receptor signaling. In a network analysis, expression of up-regulated signaling pathways was strongly associated with decreased abundance of operational taxonomic unit 1341 (OTU1341; Prevotella) among individuals with fibroblasts responsive to CpG-ODN stimulation. The expression of TLR signaling pathways was also linked to CpG-ODN responsive fibroblasts, OTU1341 (Prevotella), and Shannon index of microbial diversity in a network analysis. Lymphocytes expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 CD8 significantly correlated with OTU1348 (Staphylococcus). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that host-microbiome interactions influence PFS and fibroblast responsiveness.},

MMP28 (epilysin) is a member of this family of proteinases, and we have found that MMP28 is expressed by macrophages and regulates their recruitment to the lung. We hypothesized that MMP28 regulates other key macrophage responses, such as macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these MMP28-dependent changes in macrophage polarization would alter fibrotic responses in the lung. We examined the gene expression changes in WT and Mmp28-/- BMDMs, stimulated with LPS or IL-4/IL-13 to promote M1 and M2 cells, respectively. We also collected macrophages from the lungs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-exposed WT and Mmp28-/- mice to evaluate changes in macrophage polarization. Lastly, we evaluated the macrophage polarization phenotypes during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in WT and Mmp28-/- mice and assessed mice for differences in weight loss and total collagen levels. We found that MMP28 dampens proinflammatory macrophage function and promots M2 programming. In both in vivo models, we found deficits in M2 polarization in Mmp28-/- mice. In bleomycin-induced lung injury, these changes were associated with reduced fibrosis. MMP28 is an important regulator of macrophage polarization, promoting M2 function. Loss of MMP28 results in reduced M2 polarization and protection from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. These findings highlight a novel role for MMP28 in macrophage biology and pulmonary disease.},

However, the roles of IL-13R[alpha]1 in mediating lung injury/repair are unclear.

IL-13R[alpha]1 regulated a striking array of genes in the lung following bleomycin administration and Il13ra1 deficiency resulted in exacerbated bleomycin-induced disease.

In this Review, we describe the cell types that coordinate pathogen clearance and tissue repair through the serial secretion of cytokines, and discuss how the environment and comorbidity influence this response.},

abstract = {Macrophage polarization refers to how macrophages have been activated at a given point in space and time. Polarization is not fixed, as macrophages are sufficiently plastic to integrate multiple signals, such as those from microbes, damaged tissues, and the normal tissue environment. Three broad pathways control polarization: epigenetic and cell survival pathways that prolong or shorten macrophage development and viability, the tissue microenvironment, and extrinsic factors, such as microbial products and cytokines released in inflammation. A plethora of advances have provided a framework for rationally purifying, describing, and manipulating macrophage polarization. Here, I assess the current state of knowledge about macrophage polarization and enumerate the major questions about how activated macrophages regulate the physiology of normal and damaged tissues.

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

abstract = {Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived, circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells that play a role in several fibrotic disorders, including lung fibrosis. They are attracted to injured tissue by various chemokines. It is likely that fibrocytes play a detrimental role in tissue homeostasis and promote fibrosis, although this paradigm needs further confirmation. This would make fibrocytes a possible novel treatment target for fibrotic disorders. Fibrocytes also have some potential as a biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other diseases, but the promising preliminary data from single centre studies still require independent validation. Despite several, as yet, unresolved issues, it has become clear that fibrocytes are more than an incidental finding in lung injury and repair, and may hold great promise for the future of IPF management.},

abstract = {The B7 family consists of structurally related, cell-surface protein ligands, which bind to receptors on lymphocytes that regulate immune responses. Activation of T and B lymphocytes is initiated by engagement of cell-surface, antigen-specific T-cell receptors or B-cell receptors, but additional signals delivered simultaneously by B7 ligands determine the ultimate immune response. These 'costimulatory' or 'coinhibitory' signals are delivered by B7 ligands through the CD28 family of receptors on lymphocytes. Interaction of B7-family members with costimulatory receptors augments immune responses, and interaction with coinhibitory receptors attenuates immune responses. There are currently seven known members of the family: B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), inducible costimulator ligand (ICOS-L), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), programmed death-2 ligand (PD-L2), B7-H3, and B7-H4. Members of the family have been characterized predominantly in humans and mice, but some members are also found in birds. They share 20-40{\%} amino-acid identity and are structurally related, with the extracellular domain containing tandem domains related to variable and constant immunoglobulin domains. B7 ligands are expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The importance of the family in regulating immune responses is shown by the development of immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases in mice with mutations in B7-family genes. Manipulation of the signals delivered by B7 ligands has shown potential in the treatment of autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 the American Physiological Society Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal disease that involves the remodeling of the distal airspace and the lung parenchyma, which results in compromised gas exchange.

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND{\$}\backslash{\$}nThe risk of pulmonary edema is the main limiting factor in fluid therapy in the critically ill. Interstitial edema is a subclinical step that precedes alveolar edema. This study assesses a bedside tool for detecting interstitial edema, lung ultrasound. The A-line is a horizontal artifact indicating a normal lung surface. The B-line is a kind of comet-tail artifact indicating subpleural interstitial edema. The relationship between anterior interstitial edema detected by lung ultrasound and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) value was investigated. {\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHOD{\$}\backslash{\$}nWe performed a prospective study in medicosurgical ICUs of university-affiliated teaching hospitals. We enrolled 102 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients who all underwent pulmonary artery catheterization. We defined A-predominance as a majority of anterior A-lines and B-predominance as a majority of anterior B-lines. These patterns were correlated with PAOP. {\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS{\$}\backslash{\$}nFor diagnosing PAOP ≤ 13 mm Hg, A-predominance had 90{\%} specificity, 67{\%} sensitivity, 91{\%} positive predictive value, and 65{\%} negative predictive value. For diagnosing PAOP ≤ 18 mm Hg, A-predominance had 93{\%} specificity, 50{\%} sensitivity, 97{\%} positive predictive value, and 24{\%} negative predictive value, respectively. {\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS{\$}\backslash{\$}nA-predominance indicates dry interlobular septa. Specific to predicting a low PAOP value, A-predominance suggests that fluid may be given without initial concern for the development of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. B-predominance indicates interstitial syndrome, which is usually related to interstitial edema. B-predominance is observed in a wide range of PAOP values, precluding conclusions about the need for fluid therapy. This bedside potential will be appreciated by those intensivists who envision fluid therapy based on low PAOP values and who consider that using the concept of a safety factor provided by lung ultrasound is logical.},

abstract = {Introduction: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has prognostic value in various pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We determined the individual prognostic accuracy of distance walked and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT in patients with IPF. We defined a new composite index, the distance-saturation product (DSP), which is the product of distance walked and lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk test. We compared the performance of the DSP to the individual 6MWT parameters in predicting mortality. Methods: We evaluated pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk parameters and the DSP between survivors and non-survivors. The ability of each measure to discriminate outcomes was determined by receiver operator curves. Results: 81 patients (48 survivors, 33 non-survivors) were included. Pulmonary function tests were similar and did not correlate with survival. Desaturation was greater (89.4{\%} versus 83.7{\%}, P {\textless}0.001) and distance walked was lower (406.9 versus 181.3 m, P = 0.005) in non-survivors. The DSP was significantly lower among non-survivors (364.8 versus 153.5 m{\%}, P {\textless}0.001) and predicted mortality more accurately than either individual 6MWT component (P = 0.035 versus desaturation, P = 0.040 versus distance). A DSP {\textless}200 m{\%} was associated with a seven-fold greater risk of 12-month mortality and an 18.0{\%} shorter median survival compared with a DSP{\textgreater}200 m{\%} (P {\textless}0.001). Discussion: Each component of the 6-min walk independently predicted mortality in IPF with greater accuracy than spirometry. However, a composite of both parameters, the DSP, provides slightly greater accuracy and represents a novel measure for assessing survival in patients with IPF.},

abstract = {TO THE EDITOR: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown etiology that primarily affects the elderly and for which usual interstitial pneumonia is the substrate. (1) Patients with IPF usually experience progressive loss of pulmonary function and severely impaired quality of life, evolving to death. The treatment of IPF has always been a challenge. However, in late 2014, the US Food and Drug Admi-nistration approved two new drugs for the treatment of patients with this disease. Now it is clear that both drugs reduce the rate of decline in pulmonary function in individuals affected by the disease. In addition, clinical trials are underway to investigate new drugs with different mechanisms of action. We are seeing the beginning of a new era in the care of IPF patients, which is promising but also implies additional needs and concerns. In particular, health--related governmental decisions should be based on robust epidemiological data, and, unfortunately, there are few such data on IPF in Brazil. One important and still unresolved issue concerns the true incidence and prevalence of IPF and, consequently, the total number of affected patients in Brazil. When we analyzed the international literature, we found that characterizing the epidemiology of IPF is not a problem solely in Brazil. Some of the difficulties stem from the fact that the current definition of the disease came into use from 2000 onward. In addition, results vary depending on the criteria used by different authors to define a case of IPF. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that the disease affects more men than women, that it is more common after the fifth decade of life, and that its incidence has been increasing over the years, as has the associated mortality.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) develops in {\~{}}20{\%} of patients with RA. SKG mice, which are genetically prone to development of autoimmune arthritis, develop a pulmonary interstitial pneumonia that resembles human cellular and fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, has been shown to reduce the decline in lung function. Therefore, we investigated the effect of nintedanib on development of pulmonary fibrosis and joint disease in female SKG mice with arthritis induced by intraperitoneal injection of zymosan (5 mg). Nintedanib (60 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg -1{\textperiodcentered}day-1 via oral gavage) was started 5 or 10 wk after injection of zymosan. Arthritis and lung fibrosis outcome measures were assessed after 6 wk of treatment with nintedanib. A significant reduction in lung collagen levels, determined by measuring hydroxyproline levels and staining for collagen, was observed after 6 wk in nintedanib-treated mice with established arthritis and lung disease. Early intervention with nintedanib significantly reduced development of arthritis based on joint assessment and high-resolution {\$}\omega{\$}-CT. This study impacts the RA and ILD fields by facilitating identification of a therapeutic treatment that may improve both diseases. As this model replicates the characteristics of RA-ILD, the results may be translatable to the human disease.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Much research effort has been devoted to the identification of enriched gene sets for microarray experiments. However, identified gene sets are often found to be inconsistent among independent studies. This is probably owing to the noisy data of microarray experiments coupled with small sample sizes of individual studies. Therefore, combining information from multiple studies is likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes. As more and more data become available, it calls for statistical methods to integrate information from multiple studies, also known as meta-analysis, to improve the power of identifying enriched gene sets. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian model that provides a coherent framework for joint modeling of both gene set information and gene expression data from multiple studies, to improve the detection of enriched gene sets by leveraging information from different sources available. One distinct feature of our method is that it directly models the gene expression data, instead of using summary statistics, when synthesizing studies. Besides, the proposed model is flexible and offers an appropriate treatment of between-study heterogeneities that frequently arise in the meta-analysis of microarray experiments. We show that under our Bayesian model, the full posterior conditionals all have known distributions, which greatly facilitates the MCMC computation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the power of gene set enrichment meta-analysis, as opposed to existing methods developed by Shen and Tseng (2010, Bioinformatics, 26, 1316-1323), and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations from the distributional assumption for gene expression data. We illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining eight lung cancer datasets for gene set enrichment analysis, which demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

abstract = {Peripheral blood monocytes are a population of circulating mononuclear phagocytes that harbor potential to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. As in humans, monocytes in the mouse comprise two phenotypically distinct subsets that are Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) and Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high), respectively. The question remains whether these populations contribute differentially to the generation of peripheral mononuclear phagocytes. In this study, we track the fate of adoptively transferred, fractionated monocyte subsets in the lung of recipient mice. We show that under inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions, both monocyte subsets give rise to pulmonary dendritic cells. In contrast, under the conditions studied, only Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high) monocytes, but not Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) cells, had the potential to differentiate into lung macrophages. However, Gr1(high)CX(3)CR1(int) monocytes could acquire this potential upon conversion into Gr1(low)CX(3)CR1(high) cells. Our results therefore indicate an intrinsic dichotomy in the differentiation potential of the two main blood monocyte subsets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus represent a great challenge for immunocompromised patients. Pathogen detection is mediated by different receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins, and pentraxines. However, little is known about their relevance for immature human dendritic cells (iDCs). Methods: The gene expression pattern of iDCs after exposure to A. fumigatus germ tubes was studied by use of whole genome microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fungal receptors were targeted by means of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which were used to knock down expression of TLR2, TLR4, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin), PTX3 (pentraxin-related gene), dectin-1 (C-type lectin domain family 7, member A), and CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family, member 9). RESULTS: Exposure to A. fumigatus induced expression of cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, as well as genes related to fungal recognition and phagocytosis. Silencing of dectin-1 resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12), which was also reduced by anti-Dectin-1 antibody treatment prior to exposure to A. fumigatus, zymosan, or Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: Dectin-1 was identified as an important receptor for A. fumigatus and C. albicans on human iDCs and was found to be involved in the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine response.},

abstract = {Our objective was to investigate the pathogenesis pathways of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Bleomycin (BLM) induced animal models of experimental lung fibrosis were used. CHIP assay was executed to find the link between Smad3 and IL-31, and the expressions of TGF-$\beta$1, Smad3, IL-31 and STAT1 were detected to find whether they were similar with each other. We found that in the early injury or inflammation of the animal model, BLM promoted the development of inflammation, leading to severe pulmonary fibrosis. Then the expression of TGF-$\beta$1 and Smad3 increased. Activated Smad3 bound to the IL-31 promoter region, followed by the activation of JAK-STAT pathways. The inhibitor of TGF-$\beta$1 receptor decreased the IL-31 expression and knocking-down of IL-31 also decreased the STAT1 expression. We conclude that there is a pathway of pathogenesis in BLM-induced mouse model that involves the TGF-$\beta$, IL-31 and JAKs/STATs pathway. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Airway colonization by the mold Aspergillus fumigatus is common in patients with underlying lung disease and is associated with chronic airway inflammation. Studies probing the inflammatory response to colonization with A. fumigatus hyphae have been hampered by the lack of a model of chronic colonization in immunocompetent mice. By infecting mice intratracheally with conidia embedded in agar beads (Af beads), we have established an in vivo model to study the natural history of airway colonization with live A. fumigatus hyphae. Histopathological examination and galactomannan assay of lung homogenates demonstrated that hyphae exited beads and persisted in the lungs of mice up to 28 days postinfection without invasive disease. Fungal lesions within the airways were surrounded by a robust neutrophilic inflammatory reaction and peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes. Whole-lung cytokine analysis from Af bead-infected mice revealed an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines early in infection. Evidence of a Th2 type response was observed only early in the course of colonization, including increased levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), elevated IgE levels in serum, and a mild increase in airway responsiveness. Pulmonary T cell subset analysis during infection mirrored these results with an initial transient increase in IL-4-producing CD4(+) T cells, followed by a rise in IL-17 and Foxp3(+) cells by day 14. These results provide the first report of the evolution of the immune response to A. fumigatus hyphal colonization.},

Interstitial edema is a subclinical step that precedes alveolar edema. This study assesses a bedside tool for detecting interstitial edema, lung ultrasound. The A-line is a horizontal artifact indicating a normal lung surface. The B-line is a kind of comet-tail artifact indicating subpleural interstitial edema. The relationship between anterior interstitial edema detected by lung ultrasound and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) value was investigated. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD$\backslash$nWe performed a prospective study in medicosurgical ICUs of university-affiliated teaching hospitals. We enrolled 102 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients who all underwent pulmonary artery catheterization. We defined A-predominance as a majority of anterior A-lines and B-predominance as a majority of anterior B-lines. These patterns were correlated with PAOP. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nFor diagnosing PAOP ≤ 13 mm Hg, A-predominance had 90{\%} specificity, 67{\%} sensitivity, 91{\%} positive predictive value, and 65{\%} negative predictive value.

Specific to predicting a low PAOP value, A-predominance suggests that fluid may be given without initial concern for the development of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. B-predominance indicates interstitial syndrome, which is usually related to interstitial edema. B-predominance is observed in a wide range of PAOP values, precluding conclusions about the need for fluid therapy. This bedside potential will be appreciated by those intensivists who envision fluid therapy based on low PAOP values and who consider that using the concept of a safety factor provided by lung ultrasound is logical.},

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in injury and recovery in ischemic injury. They are proteolytic enzymes that degrade all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). They are secreted in a latent form, protecting the cell from damage, but once activated induce injury prior to rapid inactivation by four tissue inhibitors to metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Normally the constitutive enzymes, MMP-2 and membrane type MMP (MMP-14), are activated in a spatially specific manner and act close to the site of activation, while the inducible enzymes, MMP-3 and MMP-9, become active through the action of free radicals and other enzymes during neuroinflammation. Because of the complex nature of the interactions with tissues during development, injury and repair, the MMPs have multiple roles, participating in the injury process in the early stages and contributing to recovery during the later stages. This dual role complicates the planning of treatment strategies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Cell Interactions In Stroke.},

However, the mechanisms by which IL-9/Th9 mediate immunopathology in the lung are unknown. Here we report an IL-9-driven positive feedback loop that reinforces allergic inflammation. We show that IL-9 increases IL-2 production by mast cells, which leads to expansion of CD25+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and subsequent activation of Th9 cells. Blocking IL-9 or inhibiting CD117 (c-Kit) signalling counteracts the pathogenic effect of the described IL-9-mast cell-IL-2 signalling axis. Overproduction of IL-9 is observed in expectorates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and a sex-specific variant of IL-9 is predictive of allergic reactions in female patients. Our results suggest that blocking IL-9 may be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate inflammation associated with microbial colonization in the lung, and offers a plausible explanation for gender differences in clinical outcomes of patients with CF.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Bleomycin (BLM), an antitumour drug, is known to cause interstitial pneumonia followed by pulmonary fibrosis, and has often been used to produce an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the effect of a nonapeptide thymic hormone, facteur thymique serique (FTS), on the murine lung fibrosis induced by intratracheal instillation of BLM. Treatment with FTS ameliorated BLM-induced fibrotic changes in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the reduced accumulation of hydroxyproline (HP). In addition, FTS suppressed BLM-induced cellular inflammatory response in the lungs, as evidenced by inhibition of increased lung weight, reduced accumulation of inflammatory leucocytes, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, but not macrophages, and less pronounced histopathological changes. Finally, BLM challenge increased the local synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha RANTES, MIP-2 and KC, while administration of FTS suppressed the production of these cytokines, except for MCP-1. These effects of FTS were observed only when mice received intratracheal instillation with BLM. Considered collectively, our results indicated that FTS treatment ameliorated the cellular inflammatory responses and fibrotic changes in the lungs caused by BLM and such inhibition was well correlated with reduced synthesis of several fibrosis-related cytokines, and suggested that FTS may be potentially useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

IL-13 represents an attractive target in IPF, but its disease association and mechanism of action remains unknown. In the present study, an overexpression of IL-13 and IL-13 pathway markers was associated with IPF, particularly a rapidly progressive form of this disease. Targeting IL-13 in a humanized experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis using tralokinumab (CAT354) was found to therapeutically block aberrant lung remodeling in this model. However, targeting IL-13 was also found to promote lung repair and to restore epithelial integrity. Thus, targeting IL-13 inhibits fibrotic processes and enhances repair processes in the lung.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a key component of high-density lipoproteins that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from cells and reduces vascular inflammation. We investigated whether endogenous apoA-I modulates ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation in mice. We found that apoA-I expression was significantly reduced in the lungs of OVA-challenged, compared with saline-challenged, wild-type (WT) mice. Next, to investigate the role of endogenous apoA-I in the pathogenesis of OVA-induced airway inflammation, WT and apoA-I(-/-) mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of OVA and aluminum hydroxide, followed by multiple nasal OVA challenges for 4 weeks. OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice exhibited a phenotype of increased airway neutrophils compared with WT mice, which could be rescued by an administration of a 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Multiple pathways promoted neutrophilic inflammation in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, including the up-regulated expression of (1) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A and TNF-$\alpha$), (2) CXC chemokines (CXCL5), (3) vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and (4) granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). Because concentrations of G-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly increased in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, we hypothesized that enhanced G-CSF expression may represent the predominant pathway mediating increased neutrophilic inflammation. This was confirmed by the intranasal administration of a neutralizing anti-G-CSF antibody, which significantly reduced BALF neutrophilia by 72{\%} in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, compared with mice that received a control antibody. We conclude that endogenous apoA-I negatively regulates OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, primarily via a G-CSF-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, these findings suggest that apoA-I may play an important role in modulating the severity of neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.},

abstract = {The lung is exposed to a vast array of inhaled antigens, particulate matter, and pollution. Cells present in the airways must therefore be maintained in a generally suppressive phenotype so that excessive responses to nonserious irritants do not occur; these result in bystander damage to lung architecture, influx of immune cells to the airways, and consequent impairment of gas exchange. To this end, the resident cells of the lung, which are predominantly macrophages, are kept in a dampened state. However, on occasion the suppression fails and these macrophages overreact to antigenic challenge, resulting in release of inflammatory mediators, induction of death of lung epithelial cells, deposition of extracellular matrix, and development of immunopathology. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms behind this macrophage-mediated pathology, in the context of a number of inflammatory pulmonary disorders.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a heterogeneous macrophage response that when experimentally polarized toward alternative forms of activation (M2 macrophages) promotes tissue and functional recovery. There are limited pharmacological therapies that can drive this reparative inflammatory state. In the current study, we used in vitro systems to comprehensively defined markers of macrophages with known pathological (M1) and reparative (M2) properties in SCI. We then used these markers to objectively define the macrophage activation states after SCI in response to delayed azithromycin treatment. Mice were subjected to moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI. Azithromycin or vehicle was administered beginning 30 minutes post-SCI and then daily for 3 or 7 days post injury (dpi). We detected a dose-dependent polarization toward purportedly protective M2 macrophages with daily AZM treatment. Specifically, AZM doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg decreased M1 macrophage gene expression at 3 dpi while the lowest (10 mg/kg) and highest (160 mg/kg) doses increased M2 macrophage gene expression at 7 dpi. Azithromycin has documented immunomodulatory properties and is commonly prescribed to treat infections in SCI individuals. This work demonstrates the utility of objective, comprehensive macrophage gene profiling for evaluating immunomodulatory SCI therapies and highlights azithromycin as a promising agent for SCI treatment. Spinal cord injury (SCI) activates CNS macrophages consisting of endogenous microglia and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells have pathological properties and contribute to neurodegeneration and tissue loss subsequent to the initial mechanical trauma. Activated macrophages also have the potential to promote tissue remodeling and axon regeneration 1–3 and there is growing evidence that transgenic, viral, or transplantation-mediated alterations in macrophage phenotype in SCI can be therapeutic 4 . The development of clinically viable, pharmacological interventions that harness the reparative potential of macrophages responding to SCI, however, remains a challenge facing the SCI community. To date, only one pharmacological agent, meth-ylprednisolone, is approved to treat SCI and its use is controversial. Increasingly, well-tolerated, pharmacological agents with immunomodulatory properties are being sought as therapies for SCI. Azithromycin (AZM) is a semisynthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin with significant immunomodulatory actions independent of is antibacterial properties 5,6},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively).

abstract = {Background Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen and ??-smooth muscle actin in the lung. The key molecules that promote these phenotypes are of clinical interest. Objectives Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been found at high levels in patients with asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and TSLP has been proposed as a primary driver of lung fibrotic disease. We asked whether tumor necrosis factor superfamily protein 14 (TNFSF14) (aka LIGHT) controls TSLP production to initiate fibrosis. Methods Expression of TSLP and initiation of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin were assessed in mice deficient in LIGHT. The ability of recombinant LIGHT, given intratracheally to naive mice, to promote TSLP and fibrosis was also determined. Results Genetic deletion of LIGHT abolished lung TSLP expression driven by bleomycin, accompanied by near-complete absence of accumulation of lung collagen and ??-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, recombinant LIGHT administered in vivo induced lung expression of TSLP in the absence of other inflammatory stimuli, and strikingly reproduced the primary features of bleomycin-driven disease in a TSLP-dependent manner. Blockade of LIGHT binding to either of its receptors, herpes virus entry mediator and lymphotoxin beta receptor, inhibited clinical symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, and correspondingly both receptors were found on human bronchial epithelial cells, a primary source of TSLP. Moreover, LIGHT induced TSLP directly in human bronchial epithelial cells and synergized with IL-13 and TGF-?? in vivo to promote TSLP in the lungs and drive fibrosis. Conclusions These results show that LIGHT is a profibrogenic cytokine that may be a key driver of TSLP production during the initiation and development of lung fibrotic disease.},

abstract = {Airway colonization by the mold Aspergillus fumigatus is common in patients with underlying lung disease and is associated with chronic airway inflammation. Studies probing the inflammatory response to colonization with A. fumigatus hyphae have been hampered by the lack of a model of chronic colonization in immunocompetent mice. By infecting mice intratracheally with conidia embedded in agar beads (Af beads), we have established an in vivo model to study the natural history of airway colonization with live A. fumigatus hyphae. Histopathological examination and galactomannan assay of lung homogenates demonstrated that hyphae exited beads and persisted in the lungs of mice up to 28 days postinfection without invasive disease. Fungal lesions within the airways were surrounded by a robust neutrophilic inflammatory reaction and peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes. Whole-lung cytokine analysis from Af bead-infected mice revealed an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines early in infection. Evidence of a Th2 type response was observed only early in the course of colonization, including increased levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), elevated IgE levels in serum, and a mild increase in airway responsiveness. Pulmonary T cell subset analysis during infection mirrored these results with an initial transient increase in IL-4-producing CD4(+) T cells, followed by a rise in IL-17 and Foxp3(+) cells by day 14. These results provide the first report of the evolution of the immune response to A. fumigatus hyphal colonization.},

abstract = {Differential abundance analysis is controversial throughout microbiome research. Gold standard approaches require laborious measurements of total microbial load, or absolute number of microorganisms, to accurately determine taxonomic shifts. Therefore, most studies rely on relative abundance data. Here, we demonstrate common pitfalls in comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total microbial load. We define the notion of "reference frames", which provide deep intuition about the compositional nature of microbiome data. In an oral time series experiment, reference frames alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell-count normalized data. Furthermore, reference frames identify consistent, differentially abundant microbes previously undetected in two independent published datasets from subjects with atopic dermatitis. These methods allow reassessment of published relative abundance data to reveal reproducible microbial changes from standard sequencing output without the need for new assays.},

We show that IL-9 increases IL-2 production by mast cells, which leads to expansion of CD25+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and subsequent activation of Th9 cells. Blocking IL-9 or inhibiting CD117 (c-Kit) signalling counteracts the pathogenic effect of the described IL-9-mast cell-IL-2 signalling axis. Overproduction of IL-9 is observed in expectorates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and a sex-specific variant of IL-9 is predictive of allergic reactions in female patients. Our results suggest that blocking IL-9 may be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate inflammation associated with microbial colonization in the lung, and offers a plausible explanation for gender differences in clinical outcomes of patients with CF.},

Allergen inhalation challenges were carried out 56 and 113 days after the first dose of study drug. The primary outcome variable was the late-phase asthmatic response. Other outcomes included the early-phase asthmatic response, airway hyperresponsiveness, serum IgE levels, blood and sputum eosinophils, safety and tolerability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Treatment with anti-OX40L MAb did not attenuate the early- or late-phase asthmatic responses at days 56 or 113 compared with placebo. In the anti-OX40L MAb treatment group, total IgE was reduced 17{\%} from pre-dosing levels, and sputum eosinophils decreased 75{\%} by day 113 (both P = 0.04). There was no effect of anti-OX40L MAb on airway hyperresponsiveness or blood eosinophils. The frequency of AEs was similar in both groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pharmacological activity of anti-OX40L MAb was observed by decreases in serum total IgE and airway eosinophils at 16 weeks post-dosing, but there was no effect on allergen-induced airway responses. It is possible that the treatment duration or dose of antibody was insufficient to impact the airway responses.},

abstract = {Monocytes and macrophages provide the first line of defense against pathogens. They also initiate acquired immunity by processing and presenting antigens and pro- vide the downstream effector functions. Analysis of large gene expression datasets from multiple cells and tissues reveals sets of genes that are co-regulated with the transcription factors that regulate them. In macrophages, the gene clusters include lineage-specific genes, interferon-responsive genes, early inflammatory genes, and genes required for endocytosis and lysosome function. Macrophages enter tissues and alter their function to deal with a wide range of challenges related to development and organogenesis, tissue injury, malignancy, sterile, or pathogenic inflammatory stimuli. These stimuli alter the gene expression to produce “activated macrophages” that are better equipped to eliminate the cause of their influx and to restore homeostasis. Activation or polarization states of macrophages have been classified as “classical” and “alternative” or M1 and M2. These proposed states of cells are not supported by large-scale transcriptomic data, including macrophage-associated signatures from large cancer tissue datasets, where the supposed markers do not correlate with other. Individual macrophage cells differ markedly from each other, and change their func- tions in response to doses and combinations of agonists and time. The most studied macrophage activation response is the transcriptional cascade initiated by the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. This response is reviewed herein. The network topology is conserved across species, but genes within the transcriptional network evolve rapidly and differ between mouse and human. There is also considerable divergence in the sets of target genes between mouse strains, between individuals, and in other species such as pigs. The deluge of complex information related to macrophage activation can be accessed with new analytical tools and new databases that provide access for the non-expert. Keywords:},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Lung macrophages have been reported to regulate both progression and remission of bleomycin-induced diffuse PF. However, it remains unclear how macrophages contribute to silica-induced progressive nodular PF and the associated tissue cell responses in vivo. We found that lack of monocyte-derived macrophages results in the formation of diffuse PF after silica instillation. We found that the proportion and the number of monocyte-derived macrophages were persistently higher in silica-induced progressive PF compared with bleomycin-induced PF. Surprisingly, in Ccr2-/-mice, in which monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration is impaired, silica administration induced diffuse PF with loose nodule formation and greater activation of tissue cells. In the diffuse lesions, the distribution of epithelial cells, distribution of myofibroblasts, and architecture of the basement membrane were disrupted. Consistent with the development of diffuse lesions, genes that were differentially expressed in CD45-tissue cells from the lung of wild-type and Ccr2-/-mice were highly enriched in human diffuse, progressive PF. In gene ontology network analyses, many of these genes were associated with tissue remodeling and included genes not previously associated with PF, such as Mmp14, Thbs2, and Fgfr4. Overall, these results indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages prevent transition from nodular to diffuse silica-induced PF, potentially by regulating tissue cell responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal restrictive respiratory disease under the idiopathic lung disease (ILD) class. IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and has more scarring, less inflammation, and poorer prognosis than most other ILD forms. Exacerbation of IPF is rapid, with unpredictable deterio- ration of lung function, and is associated with short-term mortality. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF reports that the incidence of acute exacerbations is between 5{\%}-10{\%}. Limited real-world evidence has been identified in the United States that assesses patterns of hospitalization, exacerbation of IPF, and the associated economic burden. OBJECTIVES: To (a) characterize patients newly diagnosed with IPF and (b) examine incidence rates and costs of all-cause hospitalizations, IPF-related hospitalizations, and exacerbations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with a national com- mercial claims database from calendar years 2006 to 2011. Newly diag- nosed IPF patients were identified with either ≥ 2 claims for idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (IFA) or ≥ 1 claim for IFA and ≥ 1 claim for postinflam- matory pulmonary fibrosis and a lung biopsy or thoracic high-resolution computed tomography within 90 days of the first claim for IFA (index date). IPF-related hospitalizations and possible IPF exacerbations were defined based on diagnoses recorded on event claims. Frequency, incidence rate, duration of events, and associated costs from the third-party payer's per- spective were estimated. RESULTS: Among 1,735 identified IPF patients, 38.6{\%} had at least 1 all-cause hospitalization; 10.8{\%} had IPF-related hospitalizations; 4.6{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to hospitalization; and 72.1{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to urgent outpatient visits dur- ing the 1-year post-index period. Incident rates for these 4 events were 83 (95{\%} CI = 79-88), 17 (95{\%} CI = 14-19), 7 (95{\%} CI = 6-9), and 277 (95{\%} CI = 269-286) per 100 person-years, respectively. Average costs per event were {\$}13,987 (SD = {\$}41,988), {\$}16,812 (SD = {\$}66,399), {\$}14,731 (SD = {\$}85,468), and {\$}444 (SD = {\$}1,481), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and possible exacerbations among patients with IPF were costly. Appropriate management of IPF needs to be consid- ered to help slow IPF disease progression. J},

abstract = {A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

This continually transports toxic chemicals and particles or pathogenic microorganisms deep into the respiratory system, posing a challenge to physicochemical barriers and the local immune system. Thus, complex structures and mechanisms have evolved to recognize and fend off environmental dangers while at the same time allowing efficient gas exchange. Here we review our current knowledge regarding cellular mechanisms of the immune system in context with the highly specialized anatomical features of the airways and especially the alveolar compartment. The focus is on fungal and viral infections, merging anatomical aspects well known to pulmonologists with fundamental immunological concepts. We discuss the specialized morphological constraints of immune cells compressed under a continuous layer of the surfactant lining within alveoli as well as the importance of functional polarization of respiratory tract epithelia. Furthermore, we summarize the different types of innate and adaptive immune cells and their relative contribution to lung homeostasis with respect to localization. Finally, we provide a list of currently unresolved questions with high relevance for the field that might serve as food for thought regarding future research directions.},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/{\$}\mu{\$}g TSLP and 3.77 pg/{\$}\mu{\$}g IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 and 94.3{\%} accuracy. Cut-off values of 4.66 pg/{\$}\mu{\$}g TSLP and 2.52 pg/{\$}\mu{\$}g IL-33 possessed 99.4 and 93.2{\%} accuracy for differentiating among the IPF and other interstitial lung disease groups. Conclusions: Innate immune responses may be associated with the development of IPF. Furthermore, the IL-33 and TSLP levels in BAL fluids may be useful for differentiating IPF from other chronic interstitial lung diseases.},

Current perceptions are based around the concept that CD86 is the initial co-stimulatory ligand based on its more abundant and earlier expression pattern; CD80 has a role following antigen-presenting-cell activation. We describe an alternative view in which CD80 is the initial ligand, responsible for maintaining aspects of immune tolerance through interactions with CD152.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review examines the recent literature on molecular biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specific attention is dedicated to the recent studies that identified the genes associated with IPF and the peripheral blood biomarkers that predict outcome in IPF. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple studies attempted to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in IPF. Until recently, these studies were limited in size and lacked replication, but still when taken together provided convincing evidence that changes in blood proteins (KL-6, SP-A, MMP-7, CCL-18, among others) or cells (fibrocytes and T-cell subpopulations) are indicative of the disease presence and outcome. More recently, larger studies have identified gene polymorphisms associated with IPF, as well as protein markers and integrated clinical and molecular prediction rules that accurately predict outcome in patients with IPF. SUMMARY The peripheral blood contains disease presence and outcome relevant information, and suggests distinct biologically defined outcome trajectories in patients with IPF. Although recently identified biomarkers should still be validated in multiple clinical contexts, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that collection of peripheral blood biomarkers needs to be incorporated in the design of drug studies and that some of these markers be clinically evaluated in lung transplant prioritization.},

Despite the attempts to establish a link between them, the shared biological mechanisms are yet to be characterized. An integrated gene expression meta-analysis of five independent publicly available microarray data of the three diseases was conducted to identify shared gene expression signatures and overlapping biological processes. Using INMEX bioinformatic tool, based on combined Effect Size (ES) approaches, we identified a total of 1,157 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (697 overexpressed and 460 underexpressed genes) shared between the three diseases. EnrichR tool's rich library was used for comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis which revealed “mRNA Splicing” and “SUMO E3 ligases SUMOylate target proteins” among the most enriched terms. Network based meta- analysis identified MYC and FN1 to be the most highly ranked hub genes. Our results reveal that the alterations in biomarkers of the coagulation cascade like F2R, PROS1, SELPLG and ITGB2 were common between the three diseases. Interestingly, the study has generated a novel database of candidate genetic markers, pathways and transcription factors shared between thrombosis and MPDs, which might aid in the development of prognostic therapeutic biomarkers.

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

abstract = {In sarcoidosis, increased Th17 cell fractions have been reported in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and elevated numbers of Th17 cells producing IFN- ? have been observed in peripheral blood. The balance between Th1, Th17, and FoxP3 + CD4 + T cell subsets in sarcoidosis remains unclear. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells, from 30 patients with sarcoidosis, 18 patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, and 15 healthy controls, were investigated with flow cytometry for intracellular expression of FoxP3. In a subset of the patients, expression of the cytokines IL17A and IFN- ? was investigated. The fractions of FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells and Th17 cells were both lower in sarcoidosis compared to controls ( P = 0.017 and P = 0.011 , resp.). The proportion of Th17 cells positive for IFN- ? was greater in sarcoidosis than controls (median 72.4{\%} versus 31{\%}, P = 0.0005 ) and increased with radiologic stage ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.45 , and P = 0.03 ). IFN- ? + Th17 cells were highly correlated with Th1 cells ( N = 23 , r h o = 0.64 , and P = 0.001 ), and the ratio of IFN- ? + Th17/FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells was prominently increased in sarcoidosis. IFN- ? + Th17 cells may represent a pathogenic subset of Th17 cells, yet their expression of IFN- ? could be a consequence of a Th1-polarized cytokine milieu. Our results indicate a possible immune cell imbalance in sarcoidosis.},

abstract = {26 27 The IL-17 family of cytokines has emerged over the last two decades as a pleiotropic group of 28 molecules that function in a wide variety of both beneficial and detrimental (pathologic) 29 processes mainly in mucosal barrier tissue. The beneficial effects of IL-17 expression are 30 especially important in the lung where exposure to foreign agents is abundant. IL-17A plays an 31 important role in protection from both extracellular bacteria and fungi as well as viruses that 32 infect cells of the mucosal tracts. IL-17 co-regulated cytokines such as IL-22 are involved in 33 maintaining epithelial cell homeostasis and participate in epithelial cell repair / regeneration 34 following inflammatory insults. Thus, the IL-17 / IL-22 axis is important in both responding to, 35 and recovering from pathogens. However, aberrant or over-expression of IL-17 cytokines 36 contributes to a number of pathologic outcomes including asthma, pneumonitis, and generation 37 or exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis.

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {Monocytes and macrophages provide the first line of defense against pathogens. They also initiate acquired immunity by processing and presenting antigens and pro- vide the downstream effector functions. Analysis of large gene expression datasets from multiple cells and tissues reveals sets of genes that are co-regulated with the transcription factors that regulate them. In macrophages, the gene clusters include lineage-specific genes, interferon-responsive genes, early inflammatory genes, and genes required for endocytosis and lysosome function. Macrophages enter tissues and alter their function to deal with a wide range of challenges related to development and organogenesis, tissue injury, malignancy, sterile, or pathogenic inflammatory stimuli. These stimuli alter the gene expression to produce “activated macrophages” that are better equipped to eliminate the cause of their influx and to restore homeostasis. Activation or polarization states of macrophages have been classified as “classical” and “alternative” or M1 and M2. These proposed states of cells are not supported by large-scale transcriptomic data, including macrophage-associated signatures from large cancer tissue datasets, where the supposed markers do not correlate with other. Individual macrophage cells differ markedly from each other, and change their func- tions in response to doses and combinations of agonists and time. The most studied macrophage activation response is the transcriptional cascade initiated by the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. This response is reviewed herein. The network topology is conserved across species, but genes within the transcriptional network evolve rapidly and differ between mouse and human. There is also considerable divergence in the sets of target genes between mouse strains, between individuals, and in other species such as pigs. The deluge of complex information related to macrophage activation can be accessed with new analytical tools and new databases that provide access for the non-expert. Keywords:},

However, significant diversity in module gene content for specific cell types is associated with heterogeneity in their perfor-mance. In order to rank modules that best reflect their purported association, we have gen-erated the modular discrimination index (MDI) score that assesses expression of each module in the target cell type relative to other cells. We demonstrate that MDI scores predict modules that best reflect independently validated differences in cellular composition, and correlate with the covariance between cell numbers and module expression in human blood and tissue samples. Our analyses demonstrate that MDI scores provide an ordinal summary statistic that reliably ranks the accuracy of gene expression modules for deconvolution of cell type abundance in transcriptional data.},

abstract = {Introduction Accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has important therapeutic and prognostic implications and would be greatly aided by reliable diagnostic biomarkers as IPF has sometimes overlapping features with other interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Objectives To explore the value of serum metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 7 levels in the differential diagnosis of IPF with other ILD. Methods MMP-1/7 serum levels were measured using Luminex xMAP technology in 139 patients- 47 IPF, 36 non-IPF Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), 14 idiopathic Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (iNSIP), 29 secondary NSIP (secNSIP), 13 stage IV sarcoidosis- and 20 healthy controls, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results MMP-1 was significantly higher in IPF than non-IPF UIP (P =.042) and sarcoidosis (P =.027). MMP-7 was significantly higher in IPF than controls (P {\textless}.001), non-IPF UIP (P =.003), secNSIP (P {\textless}.001), and sarcoidosis (P {\textless}.001). The Area Under the Curve for IPF versus other ILD was 0.63 (95{\%}CI, 0.53-0.73) for MMP-1, 0.73 (95{\%}CI, 0.65-0.81) for MMP-7, and 0.74 (95{\%}CI, 0.66-0.82) for MMP-1/MMP-7 combined. Sensitivity and specificity for MMP-7 cutoff = 3.91 ng/mL was 72.3{\%} and 66.3{\%}, respectively, Positive Predictive Values = 52.3{\%} and Negative Predictive Values = 82.4{\%}. Conclusions MMP-1 and particularly MMP-7 serum levels were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF UIP, the main entity in differential diagnosis. The value of these biomarkers as additional tools in a multidisciplinary approach to IPF diagnosis needs to be considered and further explored.},

abstract = {Alternative activation of alveolar macrophages is linked to fibrosis following exposure to asbestos. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic M2 phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 ({\textgreater}3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-{\$}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF).

@article{Shalek2013,
abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

IL-13 represents an attractive target in IPF, but its disease association and mechanism of action remains unknown. In the present study, an overexpression of IL-13 and IL-13 pathway markers was associated with IPF, particularly a rapidly progressive form of this disease. Targeting IL-13 in a humanized experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis using tralokinumab (CAT354) was found to therapeutically block aberrant lung remodeling in this model. However, targeting IL-13 was also found to promote lung repair and to restore epithelial integrity. Thus, targeting IL-13 inhibits fibrotic processes and enhances repair processes in the lung.},

However, as levels of CCR2+CD4+T cells in paediatric lung fibrosis had previously been found to be increased, correlating with clinical symptoms, we hypothesised that distinct CCR2+cell populations might either increase or decrease disease pathogenesis depending on their subtype. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of CCR2+CD4+T cells in experimental lung fibrosis and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrosis. METHODS Pulmonary CCR2+CD4+T cells were analysed using flow cytometry and mRNA profiling, followed by in silico pathway analysis, in vitro assays and adoptive transfer experiments. RESULTS Frequencies of CCR2+CD4+T cells were increased in experimental fibrosis-specifically the CD62L-CD44+effector memory T cell phenotype, displaying a distinct chemokine receptor profile. mRNA profiling of isolated CCR2+CD4+T cells from fibrotic lungs suggested immune regulatory functions, a finding that was confirmed in vitro using suppressor assays. Importantly, adoptive transfer of CCR2+CD4+T cells attenuated fibrosis development. The results were partly corroborated in patients with lung fibrosis, by showing higher percentages of Foxp3+CD25+cells within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CCR2+CD4+T cells as compared with CCR2-CD4+T cells. CONCLUSION Pulmonary CCR2+CD4+T cells are immunosuppressive, and could attenuate lung inflammation and fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies completely abrogating CCR2-dependent signalling will therefore also eliminate cell populations with protective roles in fibrotic lung disease. This emphasises the need for a detailed understanding of the functions of immune cell subsets in fibrotic lung disease.},

abstract = {he origins of the mesenchymal cells participating in tissue repair and pathological processes, notably tissue fibrosis, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis, are poorly understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) represent one important source of these cells. As we discuss here, processes similar to the EMTs associated with embryo implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development are appropriated and subverted by chronically inflamed tissues and neoplasias. The identification of the signaling pathways that lead to activation of EMT programs during these disease processes is providing new insights into the plasticity of cellular phenotypes and possible therapeutic interventions},

abstract = {AIM Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by immune abnormalities, progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and microvascular injury and damage. Interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is expressed in the epidermis from patients with SSc. However, information describing the role of IL-21 in SSc is limited. METHODS We established a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) IL-21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells in peripheral blood, skin and lungs of BLM-induced mice were detected by flow cytometry; IL-21 levels in the peripheral blood were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD4(+) T cells were isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced and control mice and cultured in vitro alone or in the presence of mrIL-21 or mrIL-21 plus transforming growth factor (TGF)-{\$}\beta{\$}1. The frequency of Th17 cells was detected by flow cytometry; levels of IL-17 were evaluated by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors gamma t (ROR{\$}\gamma{\$}t) messenger RNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Compared to control mice, the frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were significantly increased in BLM-induced mice. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were correlated with dermal and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analyses indicate that IL-21 promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells from CD4(+) cells isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced mice. CONCLUSION IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSc as a Th17 effector cytokine, and IL-21 may induce the differentiation of Th17 cells in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model.},

Diagnostic accuracy refers to the quality of the information provided by the classification device and should be distinguished from the usefulness, or actual practical value, of the information. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots provide a pure index of accuracy by demonstrating the limits of a test's ability to discriminate between alternative states of health over the complete spectrum of operating conditions. Furthermore, ROC plots occupy a central or unifying position in the process of assessing and using diagnostic tools. Once the plot is generated, a user can readily go on to many other activities such as performing quantitative ROC analysis and comparisons of tests, using likelihood ratio to revise the probability of disease in individual subjects, selecting decision thresholds, using logistic-regression analysis, using discriminant-function analysis, or incorporating the tool into a clinical strategy by using decision analysis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Determine the coverage rate of syphilis testing during prenatal care and the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil. METHODS: This is a national hospital-based cohort study conducted in Brazil with 23,894 postpartum women between 2011 and 2012. Data were obtained using interviews with postpartum women, hospital records, and prenatal care cards. All postpartum women with a reactive serological test result recorded in the prenatal care card or syphilis diagnosis during hospitalization for childbirth were considered cases of syphilis in pregnancy. The Chi-square test was used for determining the disease prevalence and testing coverage rate by region of residence, self-reported skin color, maternal age, and type of prenatal and child delivery care units. RESULTS: Prenatal care covered 98.7{\%} postpartum women. Syphilis testing coverage rate was 89.1{\%} (one test) and 41.2{\%} (two tests), and syphilis prevalence in pregnancy was 1.02{\%} (95{\%}CI 0.84;1.25). A lower prenatal coverage rate was observed among women in the North region, indigenous women, those with less education, and those who received prenatal care in public health care units. A lower testing coverage rate was observed among residents in the North, Northeast, and Midwest regions, among younger and non-white skin-color women, among those with lower education, and those who received prenatal care in public health care units. An increased prevalence of syphilis was observed among women with {\textless} 8 years of education (1.74{\%}), who self-reported as black (1.8{\%}) or mixed (1.2{\%}), those who did not receive prenatal care (2.5{\%}), and those attending public (1.37{\%}) or mixed (0.93{\%}) health care units.},

abstract = {We investigated the pathogenic roles of CC chemokine ligand (CCL)3 and its receptors, CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5, in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF). An intratracheal injection of BLM into wild-type (WT) mice caused a massive infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages, followed by the development of diffuse PF with fibrocyte accumulation. Intrapulmonary CCL3 expression was enhanced rapidly and remained at elevated levels until PF developed. Moreover, CCL3 protein was detected mainly in infiltrating granulocytes and macrophages, whereas transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 protein was detected in macrophages and myofibroblasts. Compared with WT mice, collagen accumulation was reduced in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice. Moreover, the BLM-induced increases in intrapulmonary macrophage and fibrocyte numbers were attenuated in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice, although BLM increased bone marrow (BM) fibrocyte number to a similar extent in these strains. BM transplantation from CCR5-/-to WT, but not that from WT to CCR5-/-mice, recapitulated the phenotypes in CCR5-/-mice. Furthermore, CCR5+/-mice exhibited a significant reduction in BLM-induced fibrotic changes. These results demonstrated that locally produced CCL3 was involved in BLM-induced recruitment of BM-derived macrophages and fibrocytes, main producers of transforming growth factor-$\beta$1, and subsequent development of PF by interacting mainly with CCR5.

The versatility of antibodies is demonstrated by the various functions that they mediate such as neutralization, agglutination, fixation with activation of complement and activation of effector cells. Naturally occurring antibodies protect the organism against harmful pathogens, viruses and infections. In addition, almost any organic chemical induces antibody production of antibodies that would bind specifically to the chemical. These antibodies are often produced from multiple B cell clones and referred to as polyclonal antibodies. In recent years, scientists have exploited the highly evolved machinery of the immune system to produce structurally and functionally complex molecules such as antibodies from a single B clone, heralding the era of monoclonal antibodies. Most of the antibodies currently in the clinic, target components of the immune system, are not curative and seek to alleviate symptoms rather than cure disease. Our group used a novel strategy to identify reparative human monoclonal antibodies distinct from conventional antibodies. In this chapter, we discuss the therapeutic relevance of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in clinic.},

abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling technology has resulted in detailed transcriptome data for a wide range of tissues, conditions and diseases. In neuroscience, expression datasets were mostly generated using whole brain tissue samples, resulting in data from a mixture of cell types, including glial cells and neurons. Over the past few years, a rapidly increasing number of expression profiling studies using isolated microglial cell populations have been reported. In these studies, the microglia transcriptome was compared to other cell types, such as other brain cells and peripheral tissue macrophages, and related to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. A commonality found in many of these studies was that microglia possess distinct gene expression signatures. This repertoire of selectively-expressed microglial genes highlight functions beyond immune responses, such as synaptic modulation and neurotrophic support, and open up avenues to explore as-yet-unexpected roles. These data provide improved understanding of disease pathology, and complement not only the aforementioned whole brain tissue transcriptome studies, but also genome- and epigenome-wide association studies. In this review, insights obtained from isolated microglia transcriptome studies are presented, and compared to studies using other genome-wide approaches. The relation of microglia to other tissue macrophages and glial cell populations, as well as the role of microglia in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative conditions, will be discussed. Many more of these types of studies are expected in the near future, hopefully leading to the identification of novel genes and targets for neurodegenerative conditions. GLIA 2015.},

Recent studies suggest that the invasion success of many species might depend more heavily on their ability to respond to natural selection than on broad physiological tolerance or plasticity. Thus, these studies stress the importance of genetic architecture, selection upon which could result in evolutionary adaptations and possibly speciation. For instance, epistatic interactions and the action of a few genes could facilitate invasion success. These findings emphasize the utility of genomic approaches for determining invasion mechanisms, through analysis of gene expression, gene interactions, and genomic rearrangements that are associated with invasion events.},

abstract = {We describe a novel approach named REAL-Select for the non-covalent display of IgG-molecules on the surface of yeast cells for the purpose of antibody engineering and selection. It relies on the capture of secreted native full-length antibodies on the cell surface via binding to an externally immobilized ZZ domain, which tightly binds antibody Fc. It is beneficial for high-throughput screening of yeast-displayed IgG-libraries during antibody discovery and development. In a model experiment, antibody-displaying yeast cells were isolated from a 1:1,000,000 mixture with control cells confirming the maintenance of genotype-phenotype linkage. Antibodies with improved binding characteristics were obtained by affinity maturation using REAL-Select, demonstrating the ability of this system to display antibodies in their native form and to detect subtle changes in affinity by flow cytometry. The biotinylation of the cell surface followed by functionalization with a streptavidin-ZZ fusion protein is an approach that is independent of the genetic background of the antibody-producing host and therefore can be expected to be compatible with other eukaryotic expression hosts such as P. pastoris or mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Macrophage-specific expression of Arginase-1 is commonly believed to promote inflammation, fibrosis, and wound healing by enhancing L-proline, polyamine, and Th2 cytokine production. Here, however, we show that macrophage-specific Arg1 functions as an inhibitor of inflammation and fibrosis following infection with the Th2-inducing pathogen Schistosoma mansoni. Although susceptibility to infection was not affected by the conditional deletion of Arg1 in macrophages, Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice died at an accelerated rate. The mortality was not due to acute Th1/NOS2-mediated hepatotoxicity or endotoxemia. Instead, granulomatous inflammation, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension increased in infected Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice. Similar findings were obtained with Arg1(flox/flox);Tie2cre mice, which delete Arg1 in all macrophage populations. Production of Th2 cytokines increased in the infected Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice, and unlike alternatively activated wild-type macrophages, Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre macrophages failed to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro, providing an underlying mechanism for the exacerbated Th2 pathology. The suppressive activity of Arg1-expressing macrophages was independent of IL-10 and TGF-beta1. However, when exogenous L-arginine was provided, T cell proliferation was restored, suggesting that Arg1-expressing macrophages deplete arginine, which is required to sustain CD4(+) T cell responses. These data identify Arg1 as the essential suppressive mediator of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) and demonstrate that Arg1-expressing macrophages function as suppressors rather than inducers of Th2-dependent inflammation and fibrosis.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oleic acid has been used to induce acute lung injury (ALI) in animals. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the blood level of oleic acid was increased. The mechanism and therapeutic regimen of ARDS and oleic acid-induced ALI remain undefined. In the present study, we investigated the oleic acid-induced changes in lung variables for the measure of ALI, inflammatory mediators, and neutrophil-derived substances. We evaluated the effects of pretreatment and posttreatment with propofol. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g. INTERVENTIONS: We employed a conscious and unrestrained rat model. Oleic acid at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered intravenously. Propofol (30 mg/kg) was given by intravenous infusion (6 mg/kg/min for 5 mins) 30 mins before (pretreatment) and 30 mins after (posttreatment) oleic acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We monitored the arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood gas. The lung weight changes, exhaled nitric oxide, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and Evans blue content in lung tissue were determined. The plasma nitrate/nitrite, methylguanidine, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10), neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase) were detected. Histopathological examination of the lung was performed. Oleic acid caused systemic hypotension and severe ALI as evidenced by the increases in the extent of ALI, impairment of pulmonary functions (blood gas variables), and lung pathology. In addition, oleic acid significantly increased inflammatory mediators and neutrophil-derived factors but depressed Na+-K+-ATPase. The inducible nitric oxide synthase was up-regulated. Pre- or posttreatment with propofol was capable of reversing the oleic acid-induced changes and attenuating the extent of ALI. CONCLUSIONS: Oleic acid resulted in sepsis-like responses including ALI, inflammatory reaction, and increased neutrophil-derived factors. It depressed the Na+-K+-ATPase activity but up-regulated inducible nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with propofol abrogated or reversed the oleic acid-induced changes.},

abstract = {Endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have key roles in regulating physiological and pathological cellular processes. Imitating the inhibitory molecular mechanisms of TIMPs while increasing selectivity has been a challenging but desired approach for antibody-based therapy. TIMPs use hybrid protein-protein interactions to form an energetic bond with the catalytic metal ion, as well as with enzyme surface residues. We used an innovative immunization strategy that exploits aspects of molecular mimicry to produce inhibitory antibodies that show TIMP-like binding mechanisms toward the activated forms of gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9). Specifically, we immunized mice with a synthetic molecule that mimics the conserved structure of the metalloenzyme catalytic zinc-histidine complex residing within the enzyme active site. This immunization procedure yielded selective function-blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against the catalytic zinc-protein complex and enzyme surface conformational epitopes of endogenous gelatinases. The therapeutic potential of these antibodies has been demonstrated with relevant mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. Here we propose a general experimental strategy for generating inhibitory antibodies that effectively target the in vivo activity of dysregulated metalloproteinases by mimicking the mechanism employed by TIMPs.},

abstract = {Three recombinant antigens of Treponema pallidum Nichols strain were fused with GST, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, resulting in high levels of GST-rTp47 and GST-rTp17 expression, and supplementation with arginine tRNA for the AGR codon was needed to obtain GST-rTp15 overexpression. Purified fusion protein yields were 1.9, 1.7 and 5.3 mg/l of cell culture for GST-rTp47, GST-rTp17 and GST-rTp15, respectively. The identities of the antigens obtained were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using ABI Prism 310 and peptide mapping by Finningan LC/MS. These recombinant antigens were evaluated by immuno-slot blot techniques applied to 137 serum samples from patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of syphilis (61 samples), from healthy blood donors (50 samples), individuals with sexually transmitted disease other than syphilis (3 samples), and from individuals with other spirochetal diseases such as Lyme disease (20 samples) and leptospirosis (3 samples). The assay had sensitivity of 95.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 86.1 to 98.7{\%}) and a specificity of 94.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 87.0 to 98.7{\%}); a stronger reactivity was observed with fraction rTp17. The immunoreactivity results showed that fusion recombinant antigens based-immuno-slot blot techniques are suitable for use in diagnostic assays for syphilis.},

abstract = {Background: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem immuno-inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that most commonly involves the lungs. We hypothesized that an unbiased approach to identify pathways activated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells can shed light on the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Methods: We recruited 15 patients with various stages of sarcoidosis and 12 healthy controls. All subjects underwent bronchoscopy with lavage. For each subject, total RNA was extracted from BAL cells and hybridized to an Affymetrix U133A microarray. Rigorous statistical methods were applied to identify differential gene expression between subjects with sarcoidosis vs. controls. To better elucidate pathways differentially activated between these groups, we integrated network and gene set enrichment analyses of BAL cell transcriptional profiles. Results: Sarcoidosis patients were either non-smokers or former smokers, all had lung involvement and only two were on systemic prednisone. Healthy controls were all non-smokers. Comparison of BAL cell gene expression between sarcoidosis and healthy subjects revealed over 1500 differentially expressed genes. Several previously described immune mediators, such as interferon gamma, were upregulated in the sarcoidosis subjects. Using an integrative computational approach we constructed a modular network of over 80 gene sets that were highly enriched in patients with sarcoidosis. Many of these pathways mapped to inflammatory and immune-related processes including adaptive immunity, T-cell signaling, graft vs. host disease, interleukin 12, 23 and 17 signaling. Additionally, we uncovered a close association between the proteasome machinery and adaptive immunity, highlighting a potentially important and targetable relationship in the pathobiology of sarcoidosis. Conclusions: BAL cells in sarcoidosis are characterized by enrichment of distinct transcriptional programs involved in immunity and proteasomal processes. Our findings add to the growing evidence implicating alveolar resident immune effector cells in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and identify specific pathways whose activation may modulate disease progression.},

As a result of this process of sustained attrition to organs, many diseases that involve fibrosis are often progressive conditions and have a poor long-term prognosis. Inflammation is often a prelude to fibrosis, with innate and adaptive immunity involved in both the initiation and regulation of the fibrotic process. In this review, we will focus on the emerging roles of the newly described innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the generation of fibrotic disease with an examination of the potential interplay between ILC and macrophages and the adaptive immune system.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

abstract = {Bleomycin induces a transient lung fibrosis in mice that has been used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our aim was to determine a sensitive method for assessing lung function in bleomycin treated mice that correlated with the degree of lung fibrosis as measured by collagen immunohistochemistry. Bleomycin (2 U/kg) or saline was intratracheally microsprayed to male C57BL/6 mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Lung function (single compartment model, constant phase model, and work of breathing) was assessed using the flexiVent system, and after euthanasia lungs were inflated with formalin in situ for histological analysis. The lung fibrosis histopathology score for the bleomycin treated animals on day 21 was indicative of mild-to-moderate fibrosis (Saline treated control: 0 ± 0, Bleomycin treated: 4.9 ± 0.4). There were at least three large areas of fibrosis in the peribronchial alveolar regions of the lung, but less than 50{\%} of each lung was affected by fibrosis. Although changes in lung function were less obvious, volume normalized dynamic work of breathing measured at 30 ml/kg tidal volume (Saline treated control: 9.2 ± 0.1 J/l, Bleomycin treated: 10.6 ± 0.3 J/l) and the oscillatory mechanics constant phase model parameter tissue elastance (H; Saline treated control: 31 ± 2 cm H2O/ml, Bleomycin treated: 38 ± 3 cm H2O/ml) were significantly increased on day 21. The work of breathing (r = 0.83) correlated slightly better with fibrosis histopathology score than H (r = 0.64). Work of breathing can detect decrements in lung function due to pulmonary fibrosis, correlates well with the amount of collagen in the lungs, and may be a more sensitive quantitative measure of efficacy for drugs being developed to treat pulmonary fibrosis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

But summarizing this complex and multidimensional concept in a single measure is problematic. Dozens of mathematical indices have been proposed for this purpose, but these can provide contradictory results leading to misleading or incorrect conclusions about a community's diversity. In this review, we summarize the key conceptual issues underlying the measurement of ecological diversity, survey the indices most commonly used in ecology, and discuss their relative suitability. We advocate for indices that: (i) satisfy key mathematical axioms; (ii) can be expressed as so-called effective numbers; (iii) can be extended to account for disparity between types; (iv) can be parameterized to obtain diversity profiles; and (v) for which an estimator (preferably unbiased) can be found so that the index is useful for practical applications.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

Interstitial edema is a subclinical step that precedes alveolar edema. This study assesses a bedside tool for detecting interstitial edema, lung ultrasound. The A-line is a horizontal artifact indicating a normal lung surface. The B-line is a kind of comet-tail artifact indicating subpleural interstitial edema. The relationship between anterior interstitial edema detected by lung ultrasound and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) value was investigated. {\$}\backslashbackslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}n{\$}\backslashbackslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}nMETHOD{\$}\backslashbackslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}nWe performed a prospective study in medicosurgical ICUs of university-affiliated teaching hospitals.

Specific to predicting a low PAOP value, A-predominance suggests that fluid may be given without initial concern for the development of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. B-predominance indicates interstitial syndrome, which is usually related to interstitial edema. B-predominance is observed in a wide range of PAOP values, precluding conclusions about the need for fluid therapy. This bedside potential will be appreciated by those intensivists who envision fluid therapy based on low PAOP values and who consider that using the concept of a safety factor provided by lung ultrasound is logical.},

abstract = {By regulating the cell number and eliminating harmful cells, programmed cell death plays a critical role in development, homeostasis, and disease. While apoptosis is a recognized form of programmed cell death, necrosis was considered a type of uncontrolled cell death induced by extreme physical or chemical stress. However, recent studies have revealed the existence of a genetically programmed and regulated form of necrosis, termed necroptosis. Necroptosis is defined as necrotic cell death that is dependent on receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). RIPK3, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and a mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) form a multiprotein complex called a necrosome. Although necroptosis generally provides a cell-autonomous host defense, on the other hand, cell rupture caused by necroptosis induces inflammation through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as mitochondrial DNA, HMGB1, and IL-1. Previously, necroptosis was considered an alternative to apoptosis, but it is becoming increasingly clear that necroptosis itself is relevant to clinical disease, independent of apoptosis. According to some recent studies, autophagy, a cellular process for organelle and protein turnover, regulates necroptosis. This review outlines the principal components of necroptosis and provides an overview of the emerging importance of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, infection, and sepsis. We also discuss the molecular relationship between necroptosis and autophagy. Strategies targeting necroptosis may yield novel therapies for pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The analysis of lung artefacts has gained increasing importance as markers of lung pathology. B-line artefact (BLA), caused by a reverberation phenomenon, is the most important lung artefact. In this review, we discuss the current role of BLA in pneumology and explore open questions of the published consensus. METHODS We summarized current literature about BLA. Also, we presented observations on healthy subjects and patients with interstitial syndrome (pulmonary fibrosis and edema), to investigate technical factors influencing BLA visualization. RESULTS BLA imaging is influenced by more factors than recently assumed. When multiple BLA is visualized in the lung, they represent a sign of increased density due to the loss of aeration in the lung periphery. This condition may indicate different diseases including cardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse or focal interstitial lung diseases (ILD), infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Correct interpretation of BLA in lung ultrasound is strongly influenced by associated sonographic signs and careful integration of all relevant clinical information. CONCLUSIONS BLA is useful to monitor clinical response, and may become crucial in directing the diagnostic process. Further research is warranted to clarify technical adjustments, different probe and machine factors that influence the visualization of BLA.},

abstract = {Knowledge in microbiology is growing exponentially through the determination of genomic sequences of hundreds of microorganisms and the invention of new technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, to deal with this avalanche of information. These genomic data are now exploited in thousands of applications, ranging from those in medicine, agriculture, organic chemistry, public health, biomass conversion, to biomining. Microbial Biotechnology. Fundamentals of Applied Microbiology focuses on uses of major societal importance, enabling an in-depth analysis of these critically important applications. Some, such as wastewater treatment, have changed only modestly over time, others, such as directed molecular evolution, or 'green' chemistry, are as current as today's headlines. This fully revised second edition provides an exciting interdisciplinary journey through the rapidly changing landscape of discovery in microbial biotechnology. An ideal text for courses in applied microbiology and biotechnology courses, this book will also serve as an invaluable overview of recent advances in this field for professional life scientists and for the diverse community of other professionals with interests in biotechnology.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Systematic differences due to experimental features of microarray experiments are present in most large microarray data sets. Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms. These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within microarray data sets. Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of 'Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms. AVAILABILITY: Matlab software to perform DWD can be retrieved from https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the prototype of interstitial lung diseases, has the worst prognosis and is the only interstitial lung disease for which approved pharmacological treatments are available. Despite being considered a rare disease, IPF patients pose major challenges to both physicians and healthcare systems. It is estimated that a large number of IPF patients reside in BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) given their overall total population of approximately 3 billion inhabitants. Nevertheless, the limited availability of chest imaging in BRIC countries is considered a chief obstacle to diagnosis, since high-resolution computed tomography of the chest is the key diagnostic test for IPF. Further, obtaining reliable lung function tests and providing treatment access is difficult in the more rural areas of these countries. However, IPF might represent an opportunity for BRIC countries: the exponentially increasing demand for the enrollment of IPF patients in clinical trials of new drugs is predicted to face a shortage of patients - BRIC countries may thus play a crucial role in advancing towards a cure for IPF.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and remodeling of the lung architecture. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered the most common and severe form of the disease, with a median survival of approximately three years and no proven effective therapy. Despite the fact that effective treatments are absent and the precise mechanisms that drive fibrosis in most patients remain incompletely understood, an extensive body of scientific literature regarding pulmonary fibrosis has accumulated over the past 35 years. In this review, we discuss three broad areas which have been explored that may be responsible for the combination of altered lung fibroblasts, loss of alveolar epithelial cells, and excessive accumulation of ECM: inflammation and immune mechanisms, oxidative stress and oxidative signaling, and procoagulant mechanisms. We discuss each of these processes separately to facilitate clarity, but certainly significant interplay will occur amongst these pathways in patients with this disease.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease defined by the presence of nonnecrotizing granuloma in the absence of any known cause. Although clinically, the heterogeneity of sarcoidosis is well characterized, the transcriptome of the sarcoidosis and underlying molecular mechanisms are not. The signal of all transcripts, small and long noncoding RNAs, can be detected using microarrays or RNA-Sequencing. Analyzing the transcriptome of tissues that are directly affected by granulomas is of great importance to understand biology of the disease and may be predictive of disease and treatment outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple genome wide expression studies performed on sarcoidosis affected tissues were published in the last 11 years. Published studies focused to examine differences in gene expression levels between sarcoidosis vs. control tissues, stable vs. progressive form of sarcoidosis, as well as sarcoidosis vs. other diseases. Strikingly, all these transcriptomics data confirm the key role of TH1 immune response in sarcoidosis and particularly of interferon-{\$}\backslashbackslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}(IFN-{\$}\backslashbackslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}{\{}$\backslash${\}}{\}}) and type I IFN-driven signaling pathways.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oleic acid has been used to induce acute lung injury (ALI) in animals. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the blood level of oleic acid was increased. The mechanism and therapeutic regimen of ARDS and oleic acid-induced ALI remain undefined. In the present study, we investigated the oleic acid-induced changes in lung variables for the measure of ALI, inflammatory mediators, and neutrophil-derived substances. We evaluated the effects of pretreatment and posttreatment with propofol. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g. INTERVENTIONS: We employed a conscious and unrestrained rat model. Oleic acid at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered intravenously. Propofol (30 mg/kg) was given by intravenous infusion (6 mg/kg/min for 5 mins) 30 mins before (pretreatment) and 30 mins after (posttreatment) oleic acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We monitored the arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood gas. The lung weight changes, exhaled nitric oxide, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and Evans blue content in lung tissue were determined. The plasma nitrate/nitrite, methylguanidine, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10), neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase) were detected. Histopathological examination of the lung was performed. Oleic acid caused systemic hypotension and severe ALI as evidenced by the increases in the extent of ALI, impairment of pulmonary functions (blood gas variables), and lung pathology. In addition, oleic acid significantly increased inflammatory mediators and neutrophil-derived factors but depressed Na+-K+-ATPase. The inducible nitric oxide synthase was up-regulated. Pre- or posttreatment with propofol was capable of reversing the oleic acid-induced changes and attenuating the extent of ALI. CONCLUSIONS: Oleic acid resulted in sepsis-like responses including ALI, inflammatory reaction, and increased neutrophil-derived factors. It depressed the Na+-K+-ATPase activity but up-regulated inducible nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with propofol abrogated or reversed the oleic acid-induced changes.},

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) develops in {\~{}}20{\%} of patients with RA. SKG mice, which are genetically prone to development of autoimmune arthritis, develop a pulmonary interstitial pneumonia that resembles human cellular and fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, has been shown to reduce the decline in lung function. Therefore, we investigated the effect of nintedanib on development of pulmonary fibrosis and joint disease in female SKG mice with arthritis induced by intraperitoneal injection of zymosan (5 mg). Nintedanib (60 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg -1{\textperiodcentered}day-1 via oral gavage) was started 5 or 10 wk after injection of zymosan. Arthritis and lung fibrosis outcome measures were assessed after 6 wk of treatment with nintedanib. A significant reduction in lung collagen levels, determined by measuring hydroxyproline levels and staining for collagen, was observed after 6 wk in nintedanib-treated mice with established arthritis and lung disease. Early intervention with nintedanib significantly reduced development of arthritis based on joint assessment and high-resolution $\omega$-CT. This study impacts the RA and ILD fields by facilitating identification of a therapeutic treatment that may improve both diseases. As this model replicates the characteristics of RA-ILD, the results may be translatable to the human disease.},

Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms. These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within microarray data sets. Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of 'Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.

abstract = {Despite recent advances in single-cell genomic, transcriptional, and mass-cytometric profiling, it remains a challenge to collect highly multiplexed measurements of secreted proteins from single cells for comprehensive analysis of functional states. Herein, we combine spatial and spectral encoding with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchambers for codetection of 42 immune effector proteins secreted from single cells, representing the highest multiplexing recorded to date for a single-cell secretion assay. Using this platform to profile differentiated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), reveals previously unobserved deep functional heterogeneity and varying levels of pathogenic activation. Uniquely protein profiling on the same single cells before and after LPS stimulation identified a role for macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) to potentiate the activation of LPS-induced cytokine production. Advanced clustering analysis identified functional subsets including quiescent, polyfunctional fully activated, partially activated populations with different cytokine profiles. This population architecture is conserved throughout the cell activation process and prevails as it is extended to other TLR ligands and to primary macrophages derived from a healthy donor. This work demonstrates that the phenotypically similar cell population still exhibits a large degree of intrinsic heterogeneity at the functional and cell behavior level. This technology enables full-spectrum dissection of immune functional states in response to pathogenic or environmental stimulation, and opens opportunities to quantify deep functional heterogeneity for more comprehensive and accurate immune monitoring.},

abstract = {Activation of the innate immune system plays a key role in exacerbations of chronic lung disease, yet the potential role of lung fibroblasts in innate immunity and the identity of epithelial danger signals (alarmins) that may contribute to this process are unclear. The objective of the study was to identify lung epithelial-derived alarmins released during endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and oxidative stress and evaluate their potential to induce innate immune responses in lung fibroblasts. We found that treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs) with conditioned media from damaged lung epithelial cells significantly upregulated interleukin IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression (P{\textless}0.05). This effect was reduced with anti-IL-1{\$}\alpha{\$} or IL-1Ra but not anti-IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} antibody. Costimulation with a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), significantly accentuated the IL-1{\$}\alpha{\$}-induced inflammatory phenotype in PHLFs, and this effect was blocked with inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta and TGF{\$}\beta{\$}-activated kinase-1 inhibitors. Finally, Il1r1-/- and Il1a-/- mice exhibit reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophilia and collagen deposition in response to bleomycin treatment.

With site-directed mutation, we placed tryptophan to desired positions or altered its neighboring residues to screen quenching groups among 20 amino acid residues and of peptide backbones. With femtosecond resolution, we observed the ultrafast quenching dynamics within 100 ps and identified two ultrafast quenching groups, the carbonyl- and sulfur-containing residues. The former is glutamine and glutamate residues and the later is disulfide bond and cysteine residue. The quenching by the peptide-bond carbonyl group as well as other potential residues mostly occurs in longer than 100 ps. These ultrafast quenching dynamics occur at van der Waals distances through intraprotein electron transfer with high directionality. Following optimal molecular orbital overlap, electron jumps from the benzene ring of the indole moiety in a vertical orientation to the LUMO of acceptor quenching residues. Molecular dynamics simulations were invoked to elucidate various correlations of quenching dynamics with separation distances, relative orientations, local fluctuations and reaction heterogeneity. These unique ultrafast quenching pairs, as recently found to extensively occur in high-resolution protein structures, may have significant biological implications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Systematic differences due to experimental features of microarray experiments are present in most large microarray data sets. Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms. These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within microarray data sets. Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of 'Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.

abstract = {Mouse myeloma NS0 cells widely used in hybridoma technology lack the expression of a major stress protein Hsp70 which is the principal component of the basic cellular defense mechanism. These cells rapidly undergo apoptosis at the late-stationary phase of batch culture following nutrient exhaustion. Since Hsp70 was recently demonstrated to protect cells against numerous apoptotic stimuli, the aim of the present study was to examine the protective potential of the protein expression in engineered myeloma NS0 cells and in resulting hybridomas. Myeloma cells were transfected with the hsp70 gene under beta-actin gene promoter. To imitate harmful conditions that hybridoma or myeloma cells often experience when cultivated in large scale for an antibody production, NS0(wt) and NS0(hsp70) cell cultures were maintained without changing the medium for a few days, and the expression of apoptotic markers has been studied. It was found that long-term cultivation induced apoptosis in original cells manifested by typical nuclei fragmentation, DNA ladders and activation of caspase-3. In contrast, in transfected cells under the same conditions the outcome of apoptosis was postponed for 24 hours. Most relevant was that the fusion of transfected myeloma cells with immune splenocytes resulted in twofold hybridomas output compared with wild-type fusion partner. Almost half of the hybridomas continued to be hsp70-positive and maintained higher robustness in culture. The level of monoclonal antibodies production by hybridoma cells obtained with the use of NS0(wt) and NS0(hsp70) was similar, however, the secreted product was better preserved in culture supernatants of Hsp70-positive cells. It is concluded that transfection of mouse myeloma cells with the hsp70 gene can be a novel means to increase hybridoma yield and reduce the sensitivity of myeloma and hybridoma cells to culture conditions insults accompanying monoclonal antibody production.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) introduced here is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates. It allows to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When biological conditions are compared, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. The interest of the method is illustrated by its application to two real life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial), and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis corrected for multiple testing as well as a standard a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series both failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. When applied to the second illustrative data set, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets finally found to be linked with the influenza vaccine too although they were found to be associated to the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses. In our simulation study TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets.

abstract = {Although acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with inflammation and surfactant dysfunction, the precise sequence of these changes remains poorly described. We used oleic acid to study the pathogenesis of ALI in spontaneously breathing anesthetized rats. We found that lung pathology can occur far more rapidly than previously appreciated. Lung neutrophils were increased approximately threefold within 5 min, and surfactant composition was dramatically altered within 15 min. Alveolar cholesterol increased by approximately 200{\%}, and even though disaturated phospholipids increased by approximately 30{\%} over 4 h, the disaturated phospholipid-to-total phospholipid ratio fell. Although the alveolocapillary barrier was profoundly disrupted after just 15 min, with marked elevations in lung fluid ((99m)Tc-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) and (125)I-labeled albumin flux, the lung rapidly began to regain its sieving properties. Despite the restoration in lung permeability, the animals remained hypoxic even though minute ventilation was increased approximately twofold and static compliance progressively deteriorated. This study highlights that ALI can set in motion a sequence of events continuing the respiratory failure irrespective of the alveolar surfactant pool size and the status of the alveolocapillary barrier.},

abstract = {I n an interesting paper, Scotton et al. (1) reported the ef-fects of IL-13 on the transcriptional profile of human monocytes. Comparing their results with studies analyz-ing the profile induced by IL-4 in murine macrophages (2, 3), the authors notice some differences, giving as examples up-reg-ulation of Ym1 and arginase-1 in murine macrophages, but not in human monocytes. The authors suggest these differences re-flect the fact that IL-4 and IL-13 are highly similar, yet different molecules. Besides overlapping effects with IL-4, IL-13 indeed has documented nonredundant functions and effects (4, 5). However, when comparing results obtained in murine macro-phages to human monocytes, differences between monocytes and differentiated macrophages, as well as interspecies differ-ences, may be involved. Indeed, human monocytes and mono-cyte-derived macrophages exhibit differences in their response to IL-4 and IL-13 (6). Moreover, we and others recently docu-mented that, similar to IL-13, IL-4 does not induce arginase-1 in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (7, 8), in contrast to murine macrophages, where the arginine me-tabolism is even one of the discriminative criteria between so-called alternatively and classically activated macrophages (9). Furthermore, in human monocytes, under conditions inducing mannose receptor and macrophage galactose-type C-type lec-tin, markers for IL-4/IL-13-induced, alternatively activated macrophages (7), we have not detected induction by IL-4 and IL-13 of eosinophil chemotactic cytokine, the closest human homolog of mouse Ym1 by sequence identity (Fig. 1). Overall, next to similarities, murine and human alternatively activated myeloid cells exhibit distinct differences. These should be taken into consideration to make optimal use of information obtained from murine models, and to relate it to the human situation.},

abstract = {Background: The clinical course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) varies widely. Although the GAP model is useful for predicting mortality, survivals have not yet been validated for each GAP score. We aimed to elucidate how prognosis is related to GAP score and GAP stage in IPF patients. Methods: The Korean Interstitial Lung Disease Study Group conducted a national survey to evaluate various characteristics in IPF patients from 2003 to 2007. Patients were diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria of the ATS/ERS. We enrolled 1,685 patients with IPF; 1,262 had undergone DLCO measurement. Patients were stratified based on GAP score (0–7): GAP scoreGroup 0(n= 26), Group 1 (n=150), Group 2 (n=208), Group 3 (n=376), Group 4 (n= 317), Group 5 (n=138), Group 6(n= 39), and Group 7 (n=8). Results: Higher GAP score and GAP stage were associated with a poorer prognosis (p{\textless} 0.001, respectively). Survival time in Group 3 was lower than those in Groups 1 and 2 (p=0.043 and p=0.039, respectively), and higher than those in groups 4, 5, and 6 (p=0.043, p=0.032, and p= 0.003, respectively). Gender, age, and DLCO ({\%}) differed significantly between Groups 2 and 3. All four variables in the GAP model differed significantly between Groups 3 and 4. Conclusion: The GAP system showed significant predictive ability for mortality in IPF patients. However, prognosis in IPF patients with a GAP score of 3 were significantly different from those in the other stage I groups and stage II groups of Asian patients.},

abstract = {We describe a novel approach named REAL-Select for the non-covalent display of IgG-molecules on the surface of yeast cells for the purpose of antibody engineering and selection. It relies on the capture of secreted native full-length antibodies on the cell surface via binding to an externally immobilized ZZ domain, which tightly binds antibody Fc. It is beneficial for high-throughput screening of yeast-displayed IgG-libraries during antibody discovery and development. In a model experiment, antibody-displaying yeast cells were isolated from a 1:1,000,000 mixture with control cells confirming the maintenance of genotype-phenotype linkage. Antibodies with improved binding characteristics were obtained by affinity maturation using REAL-Select, demonstrating the ability of this system to display antibodies in their native form and to detect subtle changes in affinity by flow cytometry. The biotinylation of the cell surface followed by functionalization with a streptavidin-ZZ fusion protein is an approach that is independent of the genetic background of the antibody-producing host and therefore can be expected to be compatible with other eukaryotic expression hosts such as P. pastoris or mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial pneumonia. The disease pathophysiology is poorly understood and the etiology remains unclear. Recent advances have generated new therapies and improved knowledge of the natural history of IPF. These gains have been brokered by advances in technology and improved insight into the role of various genes in mediating disease, but gene expression and protein levels do not always correlate. Thus, in this paper we apply a novel large scale high throughput aptamer approach to identify more than 1100 proteins in the peripheral blood of well-characterized IPF patients and normal volunteers. We use systems biology approaches to identify a unique IPF proteome signature and give insight into biological processes driving IPF. We found IPF plasma to be altered and enriched for proteins involved in defense response, wound healing and protein phosphorylation when compared to normal human plasma. Analysis also revealed a minimal protein signature that differentiated IPF patients from normal controls, which may allow for accurate diagnosis of IPF based on easily-accessible peripheral blood. This report introduces large scale unbiased protein discovery analysis to IPF and describes distinct biological processes that further inform disease biology.},

We performed a meta-analysis of seven studies (a total of 1825 stool samples from 684 infants) to investigate effects of EBF compared to non-EBF on infant gut microbiota across different populations. In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age. These consistent findings across vastly different populations suggest that one of the mechanisms of short and long-term benefits of EBF may be alteration in gut microbes.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Lung macrophages have been reported to regulate both progression and remission of bleomycin-induced diffuse PF. However, it remains unclear how macrophages contribute to silica-induced progressive nodular PF and the associated tissue cell responses in vivo. We found that lack of monocyte-derived macrophages results in the formation of diffuse PF after silica instillation. We found that the proportion and the number of monocyte-derived macrophages were persistently higher in silica-induced progressive PF compared with bleomycin-induced PF. Surprisingly, in Ccr2-/-mice, in which monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration is impaired, silica administration induced diffuse PF with loose nodule formation and greater activation of tissue cells. In the diffuse lesions, the distribution of epithelial cells, distribution of myofibroblasts, and architecture of the basement membrane were disrupted. Consistent with the development of diffuse lesions, genes that were differentially expressed in CD45-tissue cells from the lung of wild-type and Ccr2-/-mice were highly enriched in human diffuse, progressive PF. In gene ontology network analyses, many of these genes were associated with tissue remodeling and included genes not previously associated with PF, such as Mmp14, Thbs2, and Fgfr4. Overall, these results indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages prevent transition from nodular to diffuse silica-induced PF, potentially by regulating tissue cell responses.},

abstract = {Here, we show that apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL), through both innate and adaptive immune processes, potently suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in multiple animal tumor models, including the aggressive B16F10L murine malignant melanoma model. Mice expressing the human apoA1 transgene (A1Tg) exhibited increased infiltration of CD11b(+) F4/80(+) macrophages with M1, anti-tumor phenotype, reduced tumor burden and metastasis, and enhanced survival. In contrast, apoA1-deficient (A1KO) mice showed markedly heightened tumor growth and reduced survival. Injection of human apoA1 into A1KO mice inoculated with tumor cells remarkably reduced both tumor growth and metastasis, enhanced survival, and promoted regression of both tumor and metastasis burden when administered following palpable tumor formation and metastasis development. Studies with apolipoprotein A2 revealed the anti-cancer therapeutic effect was specific to apoA1. In vitro studies ruled out substantial direct suppressive effects by apoA1 or HDL on tumor cells. Animal models defective in different aspects of immunity revealed both innate and adaptive arms of immunity contribute to complete apoA1 anti-tumor activity. This study reveals a potent immunomodulatory role for apoA1 in the tumor microenvironment, altering tumor-associated macrophages from a pro-tumor M2 to an anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Use of apoA1 to redirect in vivo elicited tumor-infiltrating macrophages toward tumor rejection may hold benefit as a potential cancer therapeutic.},

We demonstrate that these end points were attenuated in the lungs of IL-1R1– and MyD88-defi- cient mice.

abstract = {The past several years have seen the accumulation of evidence demonstrating that tissue injury induced by diverse toxicants is due not only to their direct effects on target tissues but also indirectly to the actions of resident and infiltrating macrophages. These cells release an array of mediators with cytotoxic, pro- and anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, fibrogenic, and mitogenic activity, which function to fight infections, limit tissue injury, and promote wound healing. However, following exposure to toxicants, macrophages can become hyperresponsive, resulting in uncontrolled or dysregulated release of mediators that exacerbate acute tissue injury and/or promote the development of chronic diseases such as fibrosis and cancer. Evidence suggests that the diverse activity of macrophages is mediated by distinct subpopulations that develop in response to signals within their microenvironment. Understanding the precise roles of these different macrophage populations in the pathogenic response to toxicants is key to designing effective treatments for minimizing tissue damage and chronic disease and for facilitating wound repair.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review examines the recent literature on molecular biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specific attention is dedicated to the recent studies that identified the genes associated with IPF and the peripheral blood biomarkers that predict outcome in IPF. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple studies attempted to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in IPF. Until recently, these studies were limited in size and lacked replication, but still when taken together provided convincing evidence that changes in blood proteins (KL-6, SP-A, MMP-7, CCL-18, among others) or cells (fibrocytes and T-cell subpopulations) are indicative of the disease presence and outcome. More recently, larger studies have identified gene polymorphisms associated with IPF, as well as protein markers and integrated clinical and molecular prediction rules that accurately predict outcome in patients with IPF. SUMMARY The peripheral blood contains disease presence and outcome relevant information, and suggests distinct biologically defined outcome trajectories in patients with IPF. Although recently identified biomarkers should still be validated in multiple clinical contexts, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that collection of peripheral blood biomarkers needs to be incorporated in the design of drug studies and that some of these markers be clinically evaluated in lung transplant prioritization.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable complex genetic disorder that is associated with sequence changes in 7 genes (MUC5B, TERT, TERC, RTEL1, PARN, SFTPC, and SFTPA2) and with variants in at least 11 novel loci. We have previously found that 1) a common gain-of-function promoter variant in MUC5B rs35705950 is the strongest risk factor (genetic and otherwise), accounting for 30-35{\%} of the risk of developing IPF, a disease that was previously considered idiopathic; 2) the MUC5B promoter variant can potentially be used to identify individuals with preclinical pulmonary fibrosis and is predictive of radiologic progression of preclinical pulmonary fibrosis; and 3) MUC5B may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis with MUC5B message and protein expressed in bronchiolo-alveolar epithelia of IPF and the characteristic IPF honeycomb cysts. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that excessive production of MUC5B either enhances injury due to reduced mucociliary clearance or impedes repair consequent to disruption of normal regenerative mechanisms in the distal lung. In aggregate, these novel considerations should have broad impact, resulting in specific etiologic targets, early detection of disease, and novel biologic pathways for use in the design of future intervention, prevention, and mechanistic studies of IPF.},

abstract = {Pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection of C57BL/6 mice is an established model of a chronic pulmonary fungal infection accompanied by an "allergic" response (T2) to the infection, i.e., a model of an allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Our objective was to determine whether IFN-gamma plays a role in regulating the pulmonary T2 immune response in C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice. Long-term pulmonary fungistasis was lost in IFN-gamma knockout (KO) mice, resulting in an increased pulmonary burden of fungi at wk 3. IFN-gamma was required for the early influx of leukocytes into the lungs but was not required later in the infection. By wk 3, eosinophil and macrophage numbers were elevated in the absence of IFN-gamma. The inducible NO synthase to arginase ratio was lower in the lungs of IFN-gamma KO mice and the macrophages had increased numbers of intracellular cryptococci and YM1 crystals, indicative of alternatively activated macrophages in these mice. There was evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in both wild-type and IFN-gamma KO mice by 5 wk postinfection. IFN-gamma production was not required for the development of T2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) producing cells in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes or induction of an IgE response. At a number of time points, T2 cytokine production was enhanced in IFN-gamma KO mice. Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma, C57BL/6 mice develop an augmented allergic response to C. neoformans, including enhanced generation of alternatively activated macrophages, which is accompanied by a switch from a chronic to a progressive pulmonary cryptococcal infection.},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP induce distinct activa-tion profiles in ILC2s. IL-2 further amplifies their response and in-duces an NK-like phenotype. • ILC2 plasticity is ob-served in serum-free media even when in the presence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, and absence of either IL-1b or IL-12. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a distinct branch of the lymphoid lineage composed of 3 major subpopulations: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILCs are mainly described as tissue-resident cells but can be detected at low levels in human blood. However, unlike mouse ILCs, there is still no consistent methodology to purify and culture these cells that enables in-depth analysis of their intrinsic biology. Here, we describe defined culture conditions for ILC2s, which allowed us to dissect the roles of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) individually, or in combination, in modulating ILC2 phenotype and function. We show that TSLP is important for ILC2 survival, while ILC2 activation is more dependent on IL-33, especially when in combination with IL-2 or TSLP. We found that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 and TSLP dramatically upregulated their surface expression of c-Kit and downregulated expression of the canonical markers IL-7Ra and CRTH2. IL-2 further amplified ILC2 production of IL-5, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but also induced a more natural killer (NK)–like phenotype in ILC2, with upregulation of granzyme B production by these cells. Furthermore, ILC2 plasticity was observed in serum-free SFEM II media in response to IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP stimulation and independently of IL-12 and IL-1b. This is the first comprehensive report of an in vitro culture system for human ILC2s, without the use of feeder layers, which additionally evaluates the impact of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP alone or in combination on ILC2 surface phenotype and activation status.},

abstract = {Many diseases accompanied by chronic inflammation are connected with dysregulated activation of macrophage subpopulations. Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO2-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1–5 min) experiments. We discovered that NO2-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO2-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO2-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO2-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO2-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO2-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless} 0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) play a pivotal role in helminthic infection and allergic disorders. CD4(+) T cells which produce type 2 cytokines can be generated via IL-4-dependent and -independent pathways. Although the IL-4-dependent pathway is well documented, factors that drive IL-4-independent Th2 cell differentiation remain obscure. We report here that the new cytokine IL-33, in the presence of Ag, polarizes murine and human naive CD4(+) T cells into a population of T cells which produce mainly IL-5 but not IL-4. This polarization requires IL-1R-related molecule and MyD88 but not IL-4 or STAT6. The IL-33-induced T cell differentiation is also dependent on the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-kappaB but not the induction of GATA3 or T-bet. In vivo, ST2(-/-) mice developed attenuated airway inflammation and IL-5 production in a murine model of asthma. Conversely, IL-33 administration induced the IL-5-producing T cells and exacerbated allergen-induced airway inflammation in wild-type as well as IL-4(-/-) mice. Finally, adoptive transfer of IL-33-polarized IL-5(+)IL-4(-)T cells triggered airway inflammation in naive IL-4(-/-) mice. Thus, we demonstrate here that, in the presence of Ag, IL-33 induces IL-5-producing T cells and promotes airway inflammation independent of IL-4.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We studied the global gene expression signature of acute exacerbations of IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To understand the gene expression patterns of acute exacerbations of IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: RNA was extracted from 23 stable IPF lungs, 8 IPF lungs with acute exacerbation (IPF-AEx), and 15 control lungs and used for hybridization on Agilent gene expression microarrays. Functional analysis of genes was performed with Spotfire and Genomica. Gene validations for MMP1, MMP7, AGER, DEFA1-3, COL1A2, and CCNA2 were performed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling assays were performed on the same tissues used for the microarray. ELISA for alpha-defensins was performed on plasma from control subjects, patients with stable IPF, and patients with IPF-AEx.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in IPF-AEx and IPF samples were similar for the genes that distinguish IPF from control lungs. Five hundred and seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate {\textless} 5{\%}) between stable IPF and IPF-AEx. Functional analysis of these genes did not indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes. CCNA2 and alpha-defensin protein levels were also higher and localized to the epithelium of IPF-AEx, where widespread apoptosis was also detected. alpha-Defensin protein levels were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF-AEx.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPF-AEx is characterized by enhanced epithelial injury and proliferation, as reflected by increases in CCNA2 and alpha-defensins and apoptosis of epithelium. The concomitant increase in alpha-defensins in the peripheral blood and lungs may suggest their use as biomarkers for this disorder.},

abstract = {Bleomycin (BLM), an antitumour drug, is known to cause interstitial pneumonia followed by pulmonary fibrosis, and has often been used to produce an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the effect of a nonapeptide thymic hormone, facteur thymique serique (FTS), on the murine lung fibrosis induced by intratracheal instillation of BLM. Treatment with FTS ameliorated BLM-induced fibrotic changes in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the reduced accumulation of hydroxyproline (HP). In addition, FTS suppressed BLM-induced cellular inflammatory response in the lungs, as evidenced by inhibition of increased lung weight, reduced accumulation of inflammatory leucocytes, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, but not macrophages, and less pronounced histopathological changes. Finally, BLM challenge increased the local synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha RANTES, MIP-2 and KC, while administration of FTS suppressed the production of these cytokines, except for MCP-1. These effects of FTS were observed only when mice received intratracheal instillation with BLM. Considered collectively, our results indicated that FTS treatment ameliorated the cellular inflammatory responses and fibrotic changes in the lungs caused by BLM and such inhibition was well correlated with reduced synthesis of several fibrosis-related cytokines, and suggested that FTS may be potentially useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

An established risk factor for IA is neutropenia which is encountered by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Herein we investigate the role of neutrophils in modulating host response to Aspergillus. We found that neutrophils had the propensity to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production but through different mechanisms for specific cytokines. Cellular contact was requisite for the modulation of interleukin-1 beta production by Aspergillus with the involvement of complement receptor 3. On the other hand, inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production (TNF-{\$}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}) was cell contact-independent and mediated by secreted myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specifically, the inhibition of TNF-{\$}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}by MPO was through the TLR4 pathway and involved interference with the mRNA transcription of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) / interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5).

abstract = {The clinical and commercial success of monoclonal antibodies has led to the need for very large-scale production in mammalian cell culture. This has resulted in rapid expansion of global manufacturing capacity [1], an increase in size of reactors (up to 20,000??L) and a greatly increased effort to improve process efficiency with concomitant manufacturing cost reduction. This has been particularly successful in the upstream part of the process where productivity of cell cultures has improved 100??fold in the last 15??years. This success has resulted from improvements in expression technology and from process optimisation, especially the development of fed-batch cultures. In addition to improving process/cost efficiencies, a second key area has been reducing the time taken to develop processes and produce the first material required for clinical testing and proof-of-principle. Cell line creation is often the slowest step in this stage of process development.

abstract = {The ubiquitous mold Aspergillus fumigatus threatens immunosuppressed patients as inducer of lethal invasive aspergillosis. A. fumigatus conidia are airborne and reach the alveoli, where they encounter alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). Previous studies reported the importance of the surfactant-producing AEC II during A. fumigatus infection via in vitro experiments using cell lines. We established a negative isolation protocol yielding untouched primary murine AEC II with a purity {\textgreater}90{\%}, allowing ex vivo analyses of the cells, which encountered the mold in vivo. By label-free proteome analysis of AEC II isolated from mice 24h after A. fumigatus or mock infection we quantified 2256 proteins and found 154 proteins to be significantly differentially abundant between both groups (ANOVA p value 0.01, ratio of means {\textgreater}1.5 or 0.67, quantified with {\textgreater}2 peptides). Most of these proteins were higher abundant in the infected condition and reflected a comprehensive activation of AEC II on interaction with A. fumigatus. This was especially represented by proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, hence energy production. However, the most strongly induced protein was the L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) Interleukin 4 induced 1 (IL4I1) with a 42.9 fold higher abundance (ANOVA p value 2.91-10). IL4I1 has previously been found in B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and rare neurons. Increased IL4I1 abundance in AEC II was confirmed by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistology. Furthermore, A. fumigatus infected lungs showed high levels of IL4I1 metabolic products. Importantly, higher IL4I1 abundance was also confirmed in lung tissue from human aspergilloma. Because LAAO are key enzymes for bactericidal product generation, AEC II might actively participate in pathogen defense. We provide insights into proteome changes of primary AEC II thereby opening new avenues to analyze the molecular changes of this central lung cell on infectious threats.

abstract = {In addition to the directly mutagenic effects of energy deposition in DNA, ionizing radiation is associated with a variety of untargeted and delayed effects that result in ongoing bone marrow damage. Delayed effects are genotype dependent with CBA/Ca mice, but not C57BL/6 mice, susceptible to the induction of damage and also radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrophages are a potential source of ongoing damaging signals, we have determined their gene expression profiles and we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages show widely different intrinsic expression patterns. The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure.},

Here we analyzed the M2 marker expression and intracellular signal transduction in the course of cytokine-driven differentiation. We found elevated spontaneous production of the chemokines CCL17, CCL18 and CCL22 and increased expression of CD206 by alveolar macrophages from patients with lung fibrosis. Stimulation of normal human AM with Th2 cytokines IL-4 and/or IL-10 in vitro revealed IL-4 as the most powerful inducer of M2-phenotype in AM and monocytes. Importantly, IL-10 enhanced IL-4-induced expression of CCL18 and IL-1RA in a synergistic fashion. IL-4/IL-10 stimulation induces a strong activation of STAT3 in AM from fibrosis patients. These results suggest an important role for M2 polarized AM in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and indicate that both IL-4 and IL-10 account for human AM phenotype shift to M2, as seen in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Few studies have addressed the importance of vascular remodeling in the lung during the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. For fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix to occur, there must be a geometric increase in neovascularization. We hypothesized that net angiogenesis during the pathogenesis of fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis are dependent in part upon an overexpression of the angiogenic CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). To test this hypothesis, we measured MIP-2 by specific ELISA in whole lung homogenates in either bleomycin-treated or control CBA/J mice and correlated these levels with lung hydroxyproline. We found that lung tissue from mice treated with bleomycin, compared with that from saline-treated controls, demonstrated a significant increase in the presence of MIP-2 that was correlated to a greater angiogenic response and total lung hydroxyproline content. Neutralizing anti-MIP-2 Abs inhibited the angiogenic activity of day 16 bleomycin-treated lung specimens using an in vivo angiogenesis bioassay. Furthermore, when MIP-2 was depleted in vivo by passive immunization, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced without a change in the presence of pulmonary neutrophils, fibroblast proliferation, or collagen gene expression. This was also paralleled by a reduction in angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that the angiogenic CXC chemokine, MIP-2, is an important factor that regulates angiogenesis/fibrosis in pulmonary fibrosis.},

METHODS: Bleomycin (100 mg/kg) was infused with osmotic pumps into C57BL/6 mice, and pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily for 2 wk. The lungs were removed, and single-cell suspensions were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to detect fibrocytes, which were defined as CD45 and collagen-I double-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the lung specimens to quantify fibrocytes. Chemokines in the lung digests were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of pirfenidone on alveolar macrophages was evaluated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In a therapeutic setting, pirfenidone administration was initiated 10 days after bleomycin treatment. For chemotaxis assay, lung fibrocytes were isolated with immunomagnetic selection (CD45-positive mesenchymal cells) after culture and allowed to migrate toward chemokines in the presence or absence of pirfenidone. Moreover, the effect of pirfenidone on the expression of chemokine receptors on fibrocytes was evaluated. RESULTS: Pirfenidone significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis as assessed with quantitative histology and collagen measurement. Fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mice lungs was attenuated from 26.5{\%} to 13.7{\%} by pirfenidone on FACS analysis. This outcome was also observed in a therapeutic setting. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrocytes were significantly decreased by pirfenidone administration compared with those in bleomycin-treated mice (P = 0.0097). Increased chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) and CCL12 production in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs was significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (P = 0.0003 and P {\textless}0.0001, respectively). Pirfenidone also attenuated macrophage counts stimulated by bleomycin in BAL fluid. Fibrocyte migration toward CCL2 and chemokine (CC motif) receptor-2 expression on fibrocytes was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone attenuated the fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs via attenuation of CCL2 and CCL12 production in vivo, and fibrocyte migration was inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. Fibrocyte inhibition is considered a mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of pirfenidone.},

abstract = {We investigated the pathogenic roles of CC chemokine ligand (CCL)3 and its receptors, CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5, in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF). An intratracheal injection of BLM into wild-type (WT) mice caused a massive infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages, followed by the development of diffuse PF with fibrocyte accumulation. Intrapulmonary CCL3 expression was enhanced rapidly and remained at elevated levels until PF developed. Moreover, CCL3 protein was detected mainly in infiltrating granulocytes and macrophages, whereas transforming growth factor-{\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}1 protein was detected in macrophages and myofibroblasts. Compared with WT mice, collagen accumulation was reduced in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice. Moreover, the BLM-induced increases in intrapulmonary macrophage and fibrocyte numbers were attenuated in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice, although BLM increased bone marrow (BM) fibrocyte number to a similar extent in these strains. BM transplantation from CCR5-/-to WT, but not that from WT to CCR5-/-mice, recapitulated the phenotypes in CCR5-/-mice. Furthermore, CCR5+/-mice exhibited a significant reduction in BLM-induced fibrotic changes. These results demonstrated that locally produced CCL3 was involved in BLM-induced recruitment of BM-derived macrophages and fibrocytes, main producers of transforming growth factor-{\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}1, and subsequent development of PF by interacting mainly with CCR5.

abstract = {Macrophages provide a critical systemic network cells of the innate immune system. Emerging data suggest that in addition, they have important tissue-specific functions that range from clearance of surfactant from the lungs to neuronal pruning and establishment of gut homeostasis. The differentiation and tissue-specific activation of macrophages require precise regulation of gene expression, a process governed by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin structure. We argue that epigenetic regulation of macrophages is determined by lineage- and tissue-specific transcription factors controlled by the built-in programming of myeloid development in combination with signaling from the tissue environment. Perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms of tissue macrophage identity can affect normal macrophage tissue function and contribute to pathologies ranging from obesity and autoimmunity to neurodegenerative diseases.},

A subset of patients develops significant pulmonary fibrosis, identified either on biopsy or radiologically. The term chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis (CFPA) has been suggested.Methods: We describe 11 patients with CFPA referred to our centre.Results: Mean age was 58.5 years and five were male. In nine, fibrosis was already evident on presentation, while in two it developed 3 and 6 years later. The predominant radiological feature was extensive or complete involvement of the entire lung, with minimal contralateral involvement. All patients received prolonged antifungal treatment. Two patients had surgical treatment; both developed post-operative complications. The contralateral lung remained free of significant disease in all but three patients.Conclusions: CFPA is a rare complication of CPA that is usually evident on presentation, but may develop after years in patients not on antifungals.

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Molecular mechanisms that regulate lung repair vs. progressive scarring in pulmonary fibrosis remain elusive. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are pro-fibrotic cytokines that share common receptor chains including IL-13 receptor (R) [alpha]1 and are key pharmacological targets in fibrotic diseases. However, the roles of IL-13R[alpha]1 in mediating lung injury/repair are unclear. We report dysregulated levels of IL-13 receptors in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and to some extent in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated an epithelial cell-associated gene signature that was homeostatically dependent on IL-13R[alpha]1 expression. IL-13R[alpha]1 regulated a striking array of genes in the lung following bleomycin administration and Il13ra1 deficiency resulted in exacerbated bleomycin-induced disease. Increased pathology in bleomycin-treated Il13ra1-/- mice was due to IL-13R[alpha]1 expression in structural and hematopoietic cells but not due to increased responsiveness to IL-17, IL-4, IL-13, increased IL-13R[alpha]2 or type 1 IL-4R signaling. These data highlight underappreciated protective roles for IL-13R[alpha]1 in lung injury and homeostasis.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for severe, invasive infections in neutropenic hosts. Lung clearance of A. fumigatus conidia seems to be mediated by phagocytic cells and oxygen radicals. It is not known if cytokines or nitrogen radicals are also involved. We tested for the production of TNF alpha, IL-1 and nitric oxide (NO) after stimulation of mouse macrophages with the fungus. We found that both cytokines, but not NO, were produced in a dose-dependent manner during the first 24 h of culture. Except for a faster kinetic, no appreciable differences were seen between alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, both hyphae and conidia, either alive or killed, were capable of inducing cytokines production. However, among different Aspergillus spp. only A. fumigatus and A. flavus seemed to induce significant amount of TNF alpha and IL-1, whereas A. terreus and A. niger were less effective. In no case could we detect production of NO. Finally, macrophages from dexamethasone-treated mice failed to produce cytokines in response to A. fumigatus conidia. These results indicate that in normal hosts inflammatory cytokines contribute to the natural response against Aspergillus infections and suggest that the impairment of cytokine production, in immunodepressed patients, may favour the growth and spread of the fungus},

abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating lung disease of unknown aetiology. Genetic variations in the IL1RN gene, encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), have been associated with IPF susceptibility. Several studies investigated the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or single nucleotide polymorphisms rs408392, rs419598 and rs2637988, with variable results. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of polymorphisms in IL1RN on IPF susceptibility and mRNA expression. We performed a meta-analysis of the five case-control studies that investigated an IL1RN polymorphism in IPF in a Caucasian population. In addition, we investigated whether IL1RN mRNA expression was influenced by IL1RN polymorphisms. The VNTR, rs408392 and rs419598 were in tight linkage disequilibrium, with D' {\textgreater} 0.99. Furthermore, rs2637988 was in linkage disequilibrium with the VNTR (D' = 0.90). A haploblock of VNTR*2 and the minor alleles of rs408392and rs419598 was constructed. Meta-analysis revealed that this VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with IPF susceptibility both with an allelic model (odds ratio = 1.42, p = 0.002) and a carriership model (odds ratio = 1.60, p = 0.002). IL1RN mRNA expression was significantly influenced by rs2637988, with lower levels found in carriers of the (minor) GG genotype (p {\textless} 0.001). From this meta-analysis, we conclude that the VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with susceptibility to IPF. In addition, polymorphisms in IL1RN influence IL-1Ra mRNA expression, suggesting that lower levels of IL-1Ra predispose to developing IPF. Together these findings demonstrate that the cytokine IL-1Ra plays a role in IPF pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Mononuclear phagocytes play a fundamental role in the tissue homeostasis and innate defenses against viruses and other microbial pathogens. In addition, they are likely involved in several steps of cancer development. Circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages are target cells of viral infections, including human cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 8, and the HIV, and alterations of their functional and phenotypic properties are likely involved in many tissue-degenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis and cancer. Different tissue microenvironments as well as their pathological alterations can profoundly affect the polarization state of macrophages toward the extreme phenotypes conventionally termed M1 and M2. Thus, targeting disease-associated macrophages is considered a potential approach particularly in the context of cancer-associated tumor-associated macrophages, supporting malignant cell growth and progression toward a metastatic phenotype. Of note is the fact that tumor-associated macrophages isolated from established tumors display phenotypic and functional features similar to those of in vitro-derived M2-polarized cells. Concerning HIV-1 infection, viral eradication strategies in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy should also consider the possibility to deplete, at least transiently, certain mononuclear phagocytes subsets, although the possibility of distinguishing those that are either infected or pathogenically altered remains a goal of future research. In the present review, we will focus on the recent literature concerning the role of human macrophage polarization in viral infections and cancer.},

In the mouse, ≈10{\%} of noncardiomyocytes are macrophages,1,2 and humans may have comparable numbers.1 After myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the heart through the combined effects of massive recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells and local self-renewal.1,3 Likewise, in atherosclerosis, the chronic lipid–driven inflammatory disease that is the underlying cause of myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the vessel wall, again because of recruitment and local proliferation.4 Although many of these insights have been generated in mouse models, compelling evidence from genome-wide association studies have associated innate immunity mediators with myocardial infarction,5 whereas prospective human studies have shown that blood monocyte levels can predict cardiovascular events in patients.6 

During the past decade, multiple studies have challenged and, in some cases, dismantled old assumptions about macrophage origins and functions. Many reviews and opinion pieces7–19—some of them our own20–23—have been written on the subject because the various communities interested in macrophage biology seek to contextualize the findings into a coherent narrative. We now know that, in the steady state, arterial24 and cardiac1,25–27 macrophages are mostly independent of monocytes, but in response to an inflammatory trigger, such as myocardial infarction or high-fat diet, monocyte-derived cells accumulate and differentiate to self-renewing macrophages.3,4,28,29 We also know that macrophage function goes far beyond phagocytosis. Because they reside in nearly every organ, macrophages respond and adapt to their local surroundings, and their noncanonical activities reflect their flexibility.

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks can be used to associate genes of unknown function with biological processes, to prioritize candidate disease genes or to discern transcriptional regulatory programmes. With recent advances in transcriptomics and next-generation sequencing, co-expression networks constructed from RNA sequencing data also enable the inference of functions and disease associations for non-coding genes and splice variants. Although gene co-expression networks typically do not provide information about causality, emerging methods for differential co-expression analysis are enabling the identification of regulatory genes underlying various phenotypes. Here, we introduce and guide researchers through a (differential) co-expression analysis. We provide an overview of methods and tools used to create and analyse co-expression networks constructed from gene expression data, and we explain how these can be used to identify genes with a regulatory role in disease. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of other data types with co-expression networks and offer future perspectives of co-expression analysis.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, causes invasive disease in immunocompromised humans. Although monocytes and antigen-specific CD4 T cells contribute to defense against inhaled fungal spores, how these cells interact during infection remains undefined. Investigating the role of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells during fungal infection, we find that A. fumigatus infection induces an influx of chemokine receptor CCR2- and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes into lungs and draining lymph nodes. Depletion of CCR2+cells reduced A. fumigatus conidial transport from lungs to draining lymph nodes, abolished CD4 T cell priming following respiratory challenge, and impaired pulmonary fungal clearance. In contrast, depletion of CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes during systemic fungal infection did not prevent CD4 T cell priming in the spleen. Our findings demonstrate that pulmonary CD4 T cell responses to inhaled spores require CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes and their derivatives, revealing a compartmentally restricted function for these cells in adaptive respiratory immune responses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

abstract = {The understanding of how cellular productivity is modulated in cell lines is of significant importance in the biopharmaceutical industry. Often, single molecular mechanisms fail to fully explain how specific antibody productivity is enhanced during proliferation arrest. Previously, we reported that certain physiological changes occur when proliferation is arrested by p21(CIP1) over expression. In this work, we correlate physiological and molecular factors to enhance antibody productivity. Using biomass, cell volume and total cellular protein content as a basis for determining specific productivity, it was found that total cellular protein correlated best with cellular productivity. This meant that there was no preferential increase in antibody production relative to cellular proteins in arrested cultures. However, molecular analysis of mRNA transcription and stability indicated that both processes were altered in arrested cultures resulting in up to threefold increased heavy chain mRNA levels. While flow cytometric analysis revealed that arrested cells had elevated translational capacity for both heavy and light chains, the heavy to light chain polypeptide ratio was 10-50{\%} higher than in the control. This resulted in a lower extracellular accumulation of light chains and a better utilization of cellular resources for the formation of complete antibodies. Active transcriptional regulation of heavy and light chain mRNA and the modulation of translational activities play a vital role in the modulation of overall antibody productivity of these cells. The combined effect of heavy chain mRNA enhancement and the increased cellular assembly capacity was determined to effectively increase specific productivity.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Much research effort has been devoted to the identification of enriched gene sets for microarray experiments. However, identified gene sets are often found to be inconsistent among independent studies. This is probably owing to the noisy data of microarray experiments coupled with small sample sizes of individual studies. Therefore, combining information from multiple studies is likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes. As more and more data become available, it calls for statistical methods to integrate information from multiple studies, also known as meta-analysis, to improve the power of identifying enriched gene sets. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian model that provides a coherent framework for joint modeling of both gene set information and gene expression data from multiple studies, to improve the detection of enriched gene sets by leveraging information from different sources available. One distinct feature of our method is that it directly models the gene expression data, instead of using summary statistics, when synthesizing studies. Besides, the proposed model is flexible and offers an appropriate treatment of between-study heterogeneities that frequently arise in the meta-analysis of microarray experiments. We show that under our Bayesian model, the full posterior conditionals all have known distributions, which greatly facilitates the MCMC computation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the power of gene set enrichment meta-analysis, as opposed to existing methods developed by Shen and Tseng (2010, Bioinformatics, 26, 1316-1323), and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations from the distributional assumption for gene expression data. We illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining eight lung cancer datasets for gene set enrichment analysis, which demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

There are notable differences between these two pulmonary disorders, although they do share some similarities. Gene expression profiles have been reported independently, but differences on the transcriptional level between these two entities have not been investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/RESULTS: All expression data of lung tissue samples for IPF and sarcoidosis were from published datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. After cross platform normalization, the merged sample data were grouped together and were subjected to statistical analysis for finding discriminate genes. Gene enrichments with their corresponding functions were analyzed by the online analysis engine "Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery" (DAVID) 6.7, and genes interactions and functional networks were further analyzed by STRING 9.0 and Cytoscape 3.0.0 Beta1. One hundred and thirty signature genes could potentially differentiate one disease state from another. Compared with normal lung tissue, tissue affected by IPF and sarcoidosis displayed similar signatures that concentrated on proliferation and differentiation. Distinctly expressed genes that could distinguish IPF from sarcoidosis are more enriched in processes of cilium biogenesis or degradation and regulating T cell activations. Key discriminative network modules involve aspects of bone morphogenetic protein receptor two (BMPR2) related and v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene (MYB) related proliferation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first attempt to examine the transcriptional regulation of IPF and sarcoidosis across different studies based on different working platforms. Groups of significant genes were found to clearly distinguish one condition from the other. While IPF and sarcoidosis share notable similarities in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, remarkable differences between the diseases were found at the transcription level, suggesting that the two diseases are regulated by overlapping yet distinctive transcriptional networks.},

Whereas this nomenclature was generated from monocyte-derived macrophages treated in vitro with defined cytokine stimuli, the phenotype of in vivo-derived macrophages is less understood. We completed Affymetrix-based transcriptomic analysis of macrophages from the resolution phase of a zymosan-induced peritonitis. Compared with macrophages from hyperinflamed mice possessing a pro-inflammatory nature as well as naive macrophages from the uninflamed peritoneum, resolution-phase macrophages (rM) are similar to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), being CD209a positive but lacking CD11c. They are enriched for antigen processing/presentation (MHC class II [H2-Eb1, H2-Ab1, H2-Ob, H2-Aa], CD74, CD86), secrete T- and B-lymphocyte chemokines (Xcl1, Ccl5, Cxcl13) as well as factors that enhance macrophage/DC development, and promote DC/T cell synapse formation (Clec2i, Tnfsf4, Clcf1). rM are also enriched for cell cycle/proliferation genes as well as Alox15, Timd4, and Tgfb2, key systems in the termination of leukocyte trafficking and clearance of inflammatory cells. Finally, comparison with in vitro-derived M1/M2 shows that rM are neither classically nor alternatively activated but possess aspects of both definitions consistent with an immune regulatory phenotype. We propose that macrophages in situ cannot be rigidly categorized as they can express many shades of the inflammatory spectrum determined by tissue, stimulus, and phase of inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus represent a great challenge for immunocompromised patients. Pathogen detection is mediated by different receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins, and pentraxines. However, little is known about their relevance for immature human dendritic cells (iDCs). Methods: The gene expression pattern of iDCs after exposure to A. fumigatus germ tubes was studied by use of whole genome microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fungal receptors were targeted by means of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which were used to knock down expression of TLR2, TLR4, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin), PTX3 (pentraxin-related gene), dectin-1 (C-type lectin domain family 7, member A), and CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family, member 9). RESULTS: Exposure to A. fumigatus induced expression of cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, as well as genes related to fungal recognition and phagocytosis. Silencing of dectin-1 resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12), which was also reduced by anti-Dectin-1 antibody treatment prior to exposure to A. fumigatus, zymosan, or Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: Dectin-1 was identified as an important receptor for A. fumigatus and C. albicans on human iDCs and was found to be involved in the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine response.},

abstract = {Bleomycin (BLM), an antitumour drug, is known to cause interstitial pneumonia followed by pulmonary fibrosis, and has often been used to produce an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the effect of a nonapeptide thymic hormone, facteur thymique serique (FTS), on the murine lung fibrosis induced by intratracheal instillation of BLM. Treatment with FTS ameliorated BLM-induced fibrotic changes in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the reduced accumulation of hydroxyproline (HP). In addition, FTS suppressed BLM-induced cellular inflammatory response in the lungs, as evidenced by inhibition of increased lung weight, reduced accumulation of inflammatory leucocytes, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, but not macrophages, and less pronounced histopathological changes. Finally, BLM challenge increased the local synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha RANTES, MIP-2 and KC, while administration of FTS suppressed the production of these cytokines, except for MCP-1. These effects of FTS were observed only when mice received intratracheal instillation with BLM. Considered collectively, our results indicated that FTS treatment ameliorated the cellular inflammatory responses and fibrotic changes in the lungs caused by BLM and such inhibition was well correlated with reduced synthesis of several fibrosis-related cytokines, and suggested that FTS may be potentially useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Little is known about the relative importance of monocyte and tissue-resident macrophages in the development of lung fibrosis. We show that specific genetic deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages after their recruitment to the lung ameliorated lung fibrosis, whereas tissue-resident alveolar macrophages did not contribute to fibrosis. Using transcriptomic profiling of flow-sorted cells, we found that monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation unfolds continuously over the course of fibrosis and its resolution. During the fibrotic phase, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages differ significantly from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in their expression of profibrotic genes. A population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages persisted in the lung for one year after the resolution of fibrosis, where they became increasingly similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Human homologues of profibrotic genes expressed by mouse monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during fibrosis were up-regulated in human alveolar macrophages from fibrotic compared with normal lungs. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting alveolar macrophage differentiation within the lung may ameliorate fibrosis without the adverse consequences associated with global monocyte or tissue-resident alveolar macrophage depletion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Macrophages are either classically (M1) or alternatively-activated (M2). Whereas this nomenclature was generated from monocyte-derived macrophages treated in vitro with defined cytokine stimuli, the phenotype of in vivo-derived macrophages is less understood. We completed Affymetrix-based transcriptomic analysis of macrophages from the resolution phase of a zymosan-induced peritonitis. Compared with macrophages from hyperinflamed mice possessing a pro-inflammatory nature as well as naive macrophages from the uninflamed peritoneum, resolution-phase macrophages (rM) are similar to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), being CD209a positive but lacking CD11c. They are enriched for antigen processing/presentation (MHC class II [H2-Eb1, H2-Ab1, H2-Ob, H2-Aa], CD74, CD86), secrete T- and B-lymphocyte chemokines (Xcl1, Ccl5, Cxcl13) as well as factors that enhance macrophage/DC development, and promote DC/T cell synapse formation (Clec2i, Tnfsf4, Clcf1). rM are also enriched for cell cycle/proliferation genes as well as Alox15, Timd4, and Tgfb2, key systems in the termination of leukocyte trafficking and clearance of inflammatory cells. Finally, comparison with in vitro-derived M1/M2 shows that rM are neither classically nor alternatively activated but possess aspects of both definitions consistent with an immune regulatory phenotype. We propose that macrophages in situ cannot be rigidly categorized as they can express many shades of the inflammatory spectrum determined by tissue, stimulus, and phase of inflammation.},

In recent years the long-held belief that macrophage populations in the adult are continuously replenished by monocytes from the bone marrow (BM) has been overturned with the advent of new techniques to dissect cellular ontogeny. The new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated, and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are undefined. Here, we review the emergence of these concepts and discuss current controversies and future directions in macrophage biology.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a key component of high-density lipoproteins that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from cells and reduces vascular inflammation. We investigated whether endogenous apoA-I modulates ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation in mice. We found that apoA-I expression was significantly reduced in the lungs of OVA-challenged, compared with saline-challenged, wild-type (WT) mice. Next, to investigate the role of endogenous apoA-I in the pathogenesis of OVA-induced airway inflammation, WT and apoA-I(-/-) mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of OVA and aluminum hydroxide, followed by multiple nasal OVA challenges for 4 weeks. OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice exhibited a phenotype of increased airway neutrophils compared with WT mice, which could be rescued by an administration of a 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Multiple pathways promoted neutrophilic inflammation in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, including the up-regulated expression of (1) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A and TNF-$\alpha$), (2) CXC chemokines (CXCL5), (3) vascular adhesion molecules (i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and (4) granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). Because concentrations of G-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were markedly increased in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, we hypothesized that enhanced G-CSF expression may represent the predominant pathway mediating increased neutrophilic inflammation. This was confirmed by the intranasal administration of a neutralizing anti-G-CSF antibody, which significantly reduced BALF neutrophilia by 72{\%} in OVA-challenged apoA-I(-/-) mice, compared with mice that received a control antibody. We conclude that endogenous apoA-I negatively regulates OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, primarily via a G-CSF-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, these findings suggest that apoA-I may play an important role in modulating the severity of neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal restrictive respiratory disease under the idiopathic lung disease (ILD) class. IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and has more scarring, less inflammation, and poorer prognosis than most other ILD forms. Exacerbation of IPF is rapid, with unpredictable deterio- ration of lung function, and is associated with short-term mortality. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF reports that the incidence of acute exacerbations is between 5{\%}-10{\%}. Limited real-world evidence has been identified in the United States that assesses patterns of hospitalization, exacerbation of IPF, and the associated economic burden. OBJECTIVES: To (a) characterize patients newly diagnosed with IPF and (b) examine incidence rates and costs of all-cause hospitalizations, IPF-related hospitalizations, and exacerbations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with a national com- mercial claims database from calendar years 2006 to 2011. Newly diag- nosed IPF patients were identified with either ≥ 2 claims for idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (IFA) or ≥ 1 claim for IFA and ≥ 1 claim for postinflam- matory pulmonary fibrosis and a lung biopsy or thoracic high-resolution computed tomography within 90 days of the first claim for IFA (index date). IPF-related hospitalizations and possible IPF exacerbations were defined based on diagnoses recorded on event claims. Frequency, incidence rate, duration of events, and associated costs from the third-party payer's per- spective were estimated. RESULTS: Among 1,735 identified IPF patients, 38.6{\%} had at least 1 all-cause hospitalization; 10.8{\%} had IPF-related hospitalizations; 4.6{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to hospitalization; and 72.1{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to urgent outpatient visits dur- ing the 1-year post-index period. Incident rates for these 4 events were 83 (95{\%} CI = 79-88), 17 (95{\%} CI = 14-19), 7 (95{\%} CI = 6-9), and 277 (95{\%} CI = 269-286) per 100 person-years, respectively. Average costs per event were {\$}13,987 (SD = {\$}41,988), {\$}16,812 (SD = {\$}66,399), {\$}14,731 (SD = {\$}85,468), and {\$}444 (SD = {\$}1,481), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and possible exacerbations among patients with IPF were costly. Appropriate management of IPF needs to be consid- ered to help slow IPF disease progression. J},

abstract = {The lack of a method for demonstrating the presence of Treponema pallidum by growth necessitates the use of alternative methods. Traditionally, these methods are divided into direct detection methods (animal inoculation, dark-field microscopy, etc.) and serologic tests for the presence of patient antibody against T. pallidum. Serologic methods are further divided into two classes. One class, the nontreponemal tests, detects antibodies to lipoidal antigens present in either the host or T. pallidum; examples are the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma reagin and tests. Reactivity in these tests generally indicates host tissue damage that may not be specific for syphilis. Because these tests are easy and inexpensive to perform, they are commonly used for screening, and with proper clinical signs they are suggestive of syphilis. The other class of test, the treponemal tests, uses specific treponemal antigens. Confirmation of infection requires a reactive treponemal test. Examples of the treponemal tests are the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. These tests are more expensive and complicated to perform than the nontreponemal tests. On the horizon are a number of direct antigen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PCR techniques. Several of these techniques have shown promise in clinical trials for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis that are presently difficult to diagnose.},

abstract = {Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is gradually replacing microarrays for high-throughput studies of gene expression. The main challenge of analyzing microarray data is not in finding differentially expressed genes, but in gaining insights into the biological processes underlying phenotypic differences. To interpret experimental results from microarrays, gene set analysis (GSA) has become the method of choice, in particular because it incorporates pre-existing biological knowledge (in a form of functionally related gene sets) into the analysis. Here we provide a brief review of several statistically different GSA approaches (competitive and self-contained) that can be adapted from microarrays practice as well as those specifically designed for RNA-seq. We evaluate their performance (in terms of Type I error rate, power, robustness to the sample size and heterogeneity, as well as the sensitivity to different types of selection biases) on simulated and real RNA-seq data. Not surprisingly, the performance of various GSA approaches depends only on the statistical hypothesis they test and does not depend on whether the test was developed for microarrays or RNA-seq data. Interestingly, we found that competitive methods have lower power as well as robustness to the samples heterogeneity than self-contained methods, leading to poor results reproducibility. We also found that the power of unsupervised competitive methods depends on the balance between up- and down-regulated genes in tested gene sets. These properties of competitive methods have been overlooked before. Our evaluation provides a concise guideline for selecting GSA approaches, best performing under particular experimental settings in the context of RNA-seq.},

abstract = {Understanding the functional implications of changes in gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

abstract = {Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and inter-connectivity of com- puter technology is creating unprecedented quantities of digital data. Data mining, the science of extracting useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as a young and interdisciplinary field in computer science. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, en- gineering and government, and it is widely believed that data mining will have profound impact on our society. The growing consensus that data mining can bring real value has led to an explosion in demand for novel data mining technologies and for students who are trained in data mining—students who have an understanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to real-life problems, and are trained for research and development of new data mining methods. Courses in data mining have started to sprawl all over the world. Based on this development of the field, the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee has set up the ACM SIGKDD Curriculum Committee to design a sample curriculum for data mining that gives recommendations for educating the next generation of students in data mining. Based on feedback from researchers, educators, and students, we are convinced that it is an important task to have a carefully designed, conceptually strong, technically rich, and balanced curriculum for this discipline. A comprehensive and balanced curriculum will ensure that the education in data mining sets a solid foundation for the healthy growth of the field, and it will promote systematic training of students in computer science, information sciences, and other related fields, and it will provide guidance for the training of the next generation of data mining researchers, developers and technology users. The Curriculum Committee is composed of university professors and researchers who have actively con- tributed to data mining research and education, researchers and practitioners from industry who have rich experiences in applying data mining technology, and administrators from government agencies. This report is the first draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Committee. We expect that this draft will be extensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forward to suggestions and recommendations from the Committee and from the general data mining research, development, and application community. The remainder of this report is structured as follows. First, we outline the principles that guided us in the selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief description of the prerequisites that we assume students of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Section 4 contains the core of this document, our curriculum proposal},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a highly lethal pathological process that is characterized by inflammation, fibroblast accumulation, and excessive collagen deposition. Although AKT2-mediated signaling pathways modulate inflammatory responses, their role in IPF has not been defined. We report that AKT2 deficiency (Akt2(-/-)) protected against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. Adoptive transfer of wild-type macrophages or administration of IL-13 to Akt2(-/-) mice could restore pulmonary fibrosis. In response to IL-33 treatment, Akt2(-/-) macrophages displayed decreased production of IL-13 and TGF-$\beta$1 and attenuated phosphorylation of FoxO3a compared with Akt2(+/+) macrophages. Furthermore, the expression of IL-13 was increased by small interfering RNA knockdown of FoxO3a or in FoxO3a-deficient macrophages. By evaluating lung sections from pulmonary fibrosis patients, we found that the phosphorylation of AKT2 and FoxO3a was remarkably upregulated. Collectively, these results indicate that AKT2 modulates pulmonary fibrosis through inducing TGF-$\beta$1 and IL-13 production by macrophages, and inhibition of AKT2 may be a potential strategy for treating IPF.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4{\%} and 83.4+8{\%} in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value {\textgreater}0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value {\textgreater}0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value {\textgreater}0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value {\textgreater}0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The ex vivo finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value {\textgreater}0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.},

abstract = {The lack of a method for demonstrating the presence of Treponema pallidum by growth necessitates the use of alternative methods. Traditionally, these methods are divided into direct detection methods (animal inoculation, dark-field microscopy, etc.) and serologic tests for the presence of patient antibody against T. pallidum. Serologic methods are further divided into two classes. One class, the nontreponemal tests, detects antibodies to lipoidal antigens present in either the host or T. pallidum; examples are the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma reagin and tests. Reactivity in these tests generally indicates host tissue damage that may not be specific for syphilis. Because these tests are easy and inexpensive to perform, they are commonly used for screening, and with proper clinical signs they are suggestive of syphilis. The other class of test, the treponemal tests, uses specific treponemal antigens. Confirmation of infection requires a reactive treponemal test. Examples of the treponemal tests are the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. These tests are more expensive and complicated to perform than the nontreponemal tests. On the horizon are a number of direct antigen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PCR techniques. Several of these techniques have shown promise in clinical trials for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis that are presently difficult to diagnose.},

abstract = {The clinical and commercial success of monoclonal antibodies has led to the need for very large-scale production in mammalian cell culture. This has resulted in rapid expansion of global manufacturing capacity [1], an increase in size of reactors (up to 20,000??L) and a greatly increased effort to improve process efficiency with concomitant manufacturing cost reduction. This has been particularly successful in the upstream part of the process where productivity of cell cultures has improved 100??fold in the last 15??years. This success has resulted from improvements in expression technology and from process optimisation, especially the development of fed-batch cultures. In addition to improving process/cost efficiencies, a second key area has been reducing the time taken to develop processes and produce the first material required for clinical testing and proof-of-principle. Cell line creation is often the slowest step in this stage of process development. This article will review the technologies currently used to make monoclonal antibodies with particular emphasis on mammalian cell culture. Likely future trends are also discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {Summary Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or differentiated in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic polarization conditions. Computational analysis relates a spectrum of cellular states in vivo to in-vitro-differentiated Th17 cells and unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four new genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso, and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while potentially sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.},

We aimed to identify prognostic factors, including multidimensional indices from a significant IPF cohort at the Bristol Interstitial Lung Disease Centre in the UK. Patients diagnosed with IPF between 2007 and 2014 were identified. Longitudinal pulmonary physiology and exercise testing results were collated, with all-cause mortality used as the primary outcome. Factors influencing overall, 12- and 24-month survival were identified using Cox proportional hazards modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We found in this real-world cohort of 167 patients, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and initiation of long-term oxygen were independent markers of poor prognosis. Exercise testing results predicted 12-month mortality as well as DLCO, but did not perform as well for overall survival. The Composite Physiological Index was the best performing multidimensional index, but did not outperform DLCO. Our data confirmed that patients who experienced a fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) {\textgreater}10{\%} had significantly worse survival after that point (p=0.024). Our data from longitudinal follow-up in IPF show that DLCO is the best individual prognostic marker, outperforming FVC. Exercise testing is important in predicting early poor outcome. Regular and complete review should be conducted to ensure appropriate care is delivered in a timely fashion.},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively).

abstract = {Alternative activation of alveolar macrophages is linked to fibrosis following exposure to asbestos. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic M2 phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 ({\textgreater}3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-{\$}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Arg(432) and Arg(434) in domain V of MARCO are required for the polarization of macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype as mutation of these residues reduced FIZZ1 expression (17-fold) compared with cells expressing MARCO. These observations demonstrate that a macrophage membrane protein regulates the fibrotic response to lung injury and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention.-Murthy, S., Larson-Casey, J.

A well-defined flow cytometry panel for myeloid cells in human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a flow cytometry-based panel for human BAL and lung tissue. We obtained and performed flow cytometry/sorting on human BAL cells and lung tissue. Confocal images were obtained from lung tissue using antibodies for cluster of differentiation (CD)206, CD169, and E cadherin. We defined a multicolor flow panel for human BAL and lung tissue that identifies major leukocyte populations. These include macrophage (CD206(+)) subsets and other CD206(-) leukocytes. The CD206(-) cells include: (1) three monocyte (CD14(+)) subsets, (2) CD11c(+) dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(+), HLA-DR(+)), (3) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(+)), and (4) other granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils). Using this panel on human lung tissue, we defined two populations of pulmonary macrophages: CD169(+) and CD169(-) macrophages. In lung tissue, CD169(-) macrophages were a prominent cell type. Using confocal microscopy, CD169(+) macrophages were located in the alveolar space/airway, defining them as alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CD169(-) macrophages were associated with airway/alveolar epithelium, consistent with interstitial-associated macrophages. We defined a flow cytometry panel in human BAL and lung tissue that allows identification of multiple immune cell types and delineates alveolar from interstitial-associated macrophages. This study has important implications for defining myeloid cells in human lung samples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extensive use of DNA microarray technology in the characterization of the cell transcriptome is leading to an ever increasing amount of microarray data from cancer studies. Although similar questions for the same type of cancer are addressed in these different studies, a comparative analysis of their results is hampered by the use of heterogeneous microarray platforms and analysis methods.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: In contrast to a meta-analysis approach where results of different studies are combined on an interpretative level, we investigate here how to directly integrate raw microarray data from different studies for the purpose of supervised classification analysis. We use median rank scores and quantile discretization to derive numerically comparable measures of gene expression from different platforms. These transformed data are then used for training of classifiers based on support vector machines. We apply this approach to six publicly available cancer microarray gene expression data sets, which consist of three pairs of studies, each examining the same type of cancer, i.e. breast cancer, prostate cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. For each pair, one study was performed by means of cDNA microarrays and the other by means of oligonucleotide microarrays. In each pair, high classification accuracies ({\textgreater}85{\%}) were achieved with training and testing on data instances randomly chosen from both data sets in a cross-validation analysis. To exemplify the potential of this cross-platform classification analysis, we use two leukemia microarray data sets to show that important genes with regard to the biology of leukemia are selected in an integrated analysis, which are missed in either single-set analysis.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: Cross-platform classification of multiple cancer microarray data sets yields discriminative gene expression signatures that are found and validated on a large number of microarray samples, generated by different laboratories and microarray technologies. Predictive models generated by this approach are better validated than those generated on a single data set, while showing high predictive power and improved generalization performance.},

abstract = {Background: The clinical course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) varies widely. Although the GAP model is useful for predicting mortality, survivals have not yet been validated for each GAP score. We aimed to elucidate how prognosis is related to GAP score and GAP stage in IPF patients. Methods: The Korean Interstitial Lung Disease Study Group conducted a national survey to evaluate various characteristics in IPF patients from 2003 to 2007. Patients were diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria of the ATS/ERS. We enrolled 1,685 patients with IPF; 1,262 had undergone DLCO measurement. Patients were stratified based on GAP score (0–7): GAP scoreGroup 0(n= 26), Group 1 (n=150), Group 2 (n=208), Group 3 (n=376), Group 4 (n= 317), Group 5 (n=138), Group 6(n= 39), and Group 7 (n=8). Results: Higher GAP score and GAP stage were associated with a poorer prognosis (p{\textless}0.001, respectively). Survival time in Group 3 was lower than those in Groups 1 and 2 (p=0.043 and p=0.039, respectively), and higher than those in groups 4, 5, and 6 (p=0.043, p=0.032, and p= 0.003, respectively). Gender, age, and DLCO ({\%}) differed significantly between Groups 2 and 3. All four variables in the GAP model differed significantly between Groups 3 and 4. Conclusion: The GAP system showed significant predictive ability for mortality in IPF patients. However, prognosis in IPF patients with a GAP score of 3 were significantly different from those in the other stage I groups and stage II groups of Asian patients.},

abstract = {Background: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem immuno-inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that most commonly involves the lungs. We hypothesized that an unbiased approach to identify pathways activated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells can shed light on the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Methods: We recruited 15 patients with various stages of sarcoidosis and 12 healthy controls. All subjects underwent bronchoscopy with lavage. For each subject, total RNA was extracted from BAL cells and hybridized to an Affymetrix U133A microarray. Rigorous statistical methods were applied to identify differential gene expression between subjects with sarcoidosis vs. controls. To better elucidate pathways differentially activated between these groups, we integrated network and gene set enrichment analyses of BAL cell transcriptional profiles. Results: Sarcoidosis patients were either non-smokers or former smokers, all had lung involvement and only two were on systemic prednisone. Healthy controls were all non-smokers. Comparison of BAL cell gene expression between sarcoidosis and healthy subjects revealed over 1500 differentially expressed genes. Several previously described immune mediators, such as interferon gamma, were upregulated in the sarcoidosis subjects. Using an integrative computational approach we constructed a modular network of over 80 gene sets that were highly enriched in patients with sarcoidosis. Many of these pathways mapped to inflammatory and immune-related processes including adaptive immunity, T-cell signaling, graft vs. host disease, interleukin 12, 23 and 17 signaling. Additionally, we uncovered a close association between the proteasome machinery and adaptive immunity, highlighting a potentially important and targetable relationship in the pathobiology of sarcoidosis. Conclusions: BAL cells in sarcoidosis are characterized by enrichment of distinct transcriptional programs involved in immunity and proteasomal processes. Our findings add to the growing evidence implicating alveolar resident immune effector cells in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and identify specific pathways whose activation may modulate disease progression.},

abstract = {Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, multi-systemic, autoimmune disease for which the underlying aetiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The genetic and molecular processes underlying lupus have been extensively investigated using a variety of -omics approaches, including genome-wide association studies, candidate gene studies and microarray experiments of differential gene expression in lupus samples compared to controls. This study analyses a combination of existing microarray data sets to identify differentially regulated genetic pathways that are dysregulated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients compared to unaffected controls. Two statistical approaches, quantile discretisation and scaling, are used to combine publicly available expression microarray datasets and perform a meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes implicated in interferon signaling were identified by the meta-analysis, in agreement with the findings of the individual studies that generated the datasets used. In contrast to the individual studies, however, the meta-analysis and subsequent pathway analysis additionally highlighted TLR signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and diapedesis and adhesion regulatory networks as being differentially regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients compared to controls. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to derive additional information from publicly available expression data using meta-analysis techniques, which is particularly relevant to research into rare diseases where sample numbers can be limiting.},

abstract = {Monocytes and macrophages have crucial and distinct roles in tissue homeostasis and immunity, but they also contribute to a broad spectrum of pathologies and are thus attractive therapeutic targets. Potential intervention strategies that aim to manipulate these cells will require an in-depth understanding of their origins and the mechanisms that ensure their homeostasis. Recent evidence shows that monocytes do not substantially contribute to most tissue macrophage populations in the steady state or during certain types of inflammation. Rather, most tissue macrophage populations in mice are derived from embryonic precursors, are seeded before birth and can maintain themselves in adults by self-renewal. In this Review, we discuss the evidence that has dramatically changed our understanding of monocyte and macrophage development, and the maintenance of these cells in the steady state.},

Microarray platform integration can be conceptually divided into approaches that perform early stage integration (cross-platform normalization) versus late stage data integration (meta-analysis). A growing number of statistical methods and associated software for platform integration are available to the user, however an understanding of their comparative performance and potential pitfalls is critical for best implementation. In this review we provide evidence-based, practical guidance to researchers performing cross-platform integration, particularly with an objective to discover biomarkers.},

abstract = {Macrophage activation is associated with profound transcriptional reprogramming. Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processesremain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages. This resource serves as a framework for future research into regulation of macrophage activation in health and disease. copy; 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Both interferon-gamma-producing type 1 T helper (Th1)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells have been proposed to be involved in anti-fungal host defence. Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses.},

abstract = {Human monocytes are commonly defined and discriminated by the extent of their cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, with associated differences in function and phenotype related to the intensity of expression of these markers. With increasing interest into the function and behaviour of monocytes, it is important to have a clear understanding of how differing strategies of analysis can affect results and how different protocols and population backgrounds can affect this highly morphogenic cell type.Using PBMCs from populations with differing ethnicities and histories of parasite exposure we have characterized monocyte phenotype based on intensity of CD14 and CD16 expression. Using the surface markers HLA-DR, CCR2 and CX3CR1, we compared monocyte phenotype between populations and further assessed changes in monocytes with freezing and thawing of PBMCs.Our results reveal that there is a progression of surface marker expression based on intensity of CD14 or CD16 expression, stressing the importance of careful gating of monocyte subtypes. Freezing and thawing of the PBMCs has no effect generally on the monocytes, although it does lead to a decrease in CD16 and CX3CR1 expression. We show that there are differences in the monocyte populations based on ethnicity and history of exposure to the common parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.This study highlights that blood monocytes consist of a continuous population of cells, within which the dominant phenotype may vary dependent on the background of the study population. Comparing results from monocyte studies therefore needs to be done with great care, as ethnic background of donor population, gating strategy and processing of PBMCs may all have an effect on outcome of monocyte phenotype. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

Proinflammatory cyto- kines, pathogen products, and injurious mechanical ventilation are important contributors of excessive inflammatory responses in the lung. In the present study, we used cDNA microarrays to define the gene expression patterns of A549 cells (an AEC line) in the early stages of three models of pulmonary parenchymal cell activation: cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF?) (20 ng/ml), lipopolysac- charide (LPS, 1 ?g/ml), or cyclic stretch (20{\%} elongation) for either 1 h or 4 h. Differential gene expression profiles were determined by gene array analysis. TNF? induced an inflammatory response pattern, including induction of genes for chemokines, inflammatory mediators, and cell surface membrane proteins. TNF? also increased genes related to pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, signal transduction pro- teins, and transcriptional factors. TNF? further induced a group of genes that may form a negative feedback loop to silence the NF?B pathway. Stimulation of AECs with mechanical stretch changed cell morphology and activated Src protein tyrosine kinase. The combina- tion of TNF? plus stretch enhanced or attenuated expression of multiple genes. LPS decreased microfilament polymerization but had less impact on NF?B translocation and gene expression. Results from this study indicate that AECs can tailor their response to different stimuli or/and combination of stimuli and subsequently play an important},

The molecular pathways involved in their pathogenesis are complex and despite intensive investigations have not been fully elucidated. Whereas chronic inflammatory cell infiltration is universally present in fibrotic lesions, the central role of monocytes and macrophages as regulators of inflammation and fibrosis has only recently become apparent. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to the initiation, establishment, or progression of the fibrotic process remain largely unknown. Several monocyte and macrophage subpopulations have been identified, with certain phenotypes promoting inflammation whereas others display profibrotic effects. Given the unmet need for effective treatments for fibroproliferative diseases and the crucial regulatory role of monocyte/macrophage subpopulations in fibrogenesis, the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific monocyte/macrophage subpopulations has become increasingly attractive. We will provide here an overview of the current understanding of the role of monocyte/macrophage phenotype subpopulations in animal models of tissue fibrosis and in various systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, we will discuss recent approaches to the design of effective anti-fibrotic therapeutic interventions by targeting the phenotypic differences identified between the various monocyte and macrophage subpopulations.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial pneumonia. The disease pathophysiology is poorly understood and the etiology remains unclear. Recent advances have generated new therapies and improved knowledge of the natural history of IPF. These gains have been brokered by advances in technology and improved insight into the role of various genes in mediating disease, but gene expression and protein levels do not always correlate. Thus, in this paper we apply a novel large scale high throughput aptamer approach to identify more than 1100 proteins in the peripheral blood of well-characterized IPF patients and normal volunteers. We use systems biology approaches to identify a unique IPF proteome signature and give insight into biological processes driving IPF. We found IPF plasma to be altered and enriched for proteins involved in defense response, wound healing and protein phosphorylation when compared to normal human plasma. Analysis also revealed a minimal protein signature that differentiated IPF patients from normal controls, which may allow for accurate diagnosis of IPF based on easily-accessible peripheral blood. This report introduces large scale unbiased protein discovery analysis to IPF and describes distinct biological processes that further inform disease biology.},

abstract = {Innate immune cells are complex systems that can be simultaneously activated in a variety of ways. Common methods currently used to estimate the response of innate immune cells to stimuli are usually biased toward a single mode of activation. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of designing an assay based on unbiased proteome analysis that would be capable of predicting the complex response of the innate immune system to various challenges. Monocytes were used as representative cells of the innate immune system. The underlying hypothesis was that their proteome response to different activating molecules would reflect the immunogenicity of these molecules. To identify the main modes of response, we treated the human monocytic THP-1 cell line with nine different stimuli. Differentiation and activation were determined to be the two major modes of monocyte response, with PMA causing the strongest differentiation and Pam3CSK4 causing the strongest proinflammatory activation. The established assay was applied to characterize the monocyte response to epidermal growth factor peptide containing isoaspartate, which induced differentiation but not proinflammatory activation. Because of its versatility, robustness, and specificity, this new assay is likely to find a niche among the more established immunological methods. {\textcopyright}2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have key roles in regulating physiological and pathological cellular processes. Imitating the inhibitory molecular mechanisms of TIMPs while increasing selectivity has been a challenging but desired approach for antibody-based therapy. TIMPs use hybrid protein-protein interactions to form an energetic bond with the catalytic metal ion, as well as with enzyme surface residues. We used an innovative immunization strategy that exploits aspects of molecular mimicry to produce inhibitory antibodies that show TIMP-like binding mechanisms toward the activated forms of gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9). Specifically, we immunized mice with a synthetic molecule that mimics the conserved structure of the metalloenzyme catalytic zinc-histidine complex residing within the enzyme active site. This immunization procedure yielded selective function-blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against the catalytic zinc-protein complex and enzyme surface conformational epitopes of endogenous gelatinases. The therapeutic potential of these antibodies has been demonstrated with relevant mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. Here we propose a general experimental strategy for generating inhibitory antibodies that effectively target the in vivo activity of dysregulated metalloproteinases by mimicking the mechanism employed by TIMPs.},

abstract = {Importance of chronic fibroproliferative diseases (FDs) including pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular or liver fibrosis is rapidly increasing and they have become a major public health problem. According to some estimates about 45{\%} of all deaths are attributed to FDs in the developed world. Independently of their etiology the common hallmark of FDs is chronic inflammation. Infiltrating immune cells, endothelial, epithelial, and other resident cells of the injured organ release an orchestra of inflammatory mediators, which stimulate the proliferation and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production of myofibroblasts, the effector cells of organ fibrosis. Abnormal amount of ECM disturbs the original organ architecture leading to the decline of function. Although our knowledge is rapidly expanding, we still have neither a diagnostic tool to detect nor a drug to specifically target fibrosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the more comprehensive understanding of the pathomechanism of fibrosis and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the present review we provide an overview of the common key mediators of organ fibrosis highlighting the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine family members (IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26), which recently came into focus as tissue remodeling-related inflammatory cytokines.},

The beneficial effects of IL-17 expression are 30 especially important in the lung where exposure to foreign agents is abundant. IL-17A plays an 31 important role in protection from both extracellular bacteria and fungi as well as viruses that 32 infect cells of the mucosal tracts.

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients. In the immunocompetent host, inhaled conidia are cleared by alveolar macrophages. The signaling pathways of the alveolar macrophage involved in the clearance of A. fumigatus are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of TLRs in the immune response against A. fumigatus and their contribution to the signaling events triggered in murine alveolar macrophages upon infection with A. fumigatus conidia. Specifically, we examined the MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation and cytokine signaling. Our investigations revealed that immunocompetent TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were not more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis as compared with wild-type mice and that the in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK and p38 was not affected in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 knockout mice following stimulation with conidia. In vivo experiments suggest that ERK was an essential MAPK in the defense against A. fumigatus, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB appeared to play only a secondary role. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLR2/4 recognition and MyD88 signaling are dispensable for the clearance of A. fumigatus under immunocompetent situations. Furthermore, our data stress the important role of ERK activation in innate immunity to A. fumigatus.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with chronic diseases such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Because of constant exposure to this fungus, it is critical for the host to exercise an immediate and decisive immune response to clear fungal spores to ward off disease. In this study, we observed that rapidly after infection by A. fumigatus, alveolar macrophages predominantly express Arginase 1 (Arg1), a key marker of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). The macrophages were also found to express Ym1 and CD206 that are also expressed by AAMs but not NOS2, which is expressed by classically activated macrophages. The expression of Arg1 was reduced in the absence of the known signaling axis, IL-4Ralpha/STAT6, for AAM development. While both Dectin-1 and TLR expressed on the cell surface have been shown to sense A. fumigatus, fungus-induced Arg1 expression in CD11c(+) alveolar macrophages was not dependent on either Dectin-1 or the adaptor MyD88 that mediates intracellular signaling by most TLRs. Alveolar macrophages from WT mice efficiently phagocytosed fungal conidia, but those from mice deficient in Dectin-1 showed impaired fungal uptake. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate-filled liposomes increased fungal burden in infected mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that alveolar macrophages, which predominantly acquire an AAM phenotype following A. fumigatus infection, have a protective role in defense against this fungus.},

abstract = {In addition to the directly mutagenic effects of energy deposition in DNA, ionizing radiation is associated with a variety of untargeted and delayed effects that result in ongoing bone marrow damage. Delayed effects are genotype dependent with CBA/Ca mice, but not C57BL/6 mice, susceptible to the induction of damage and also radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrophages are a potential source of ongoing damaging signals, we have determined their gene expression profiles and we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages show widely different intrinsic expression patterns. The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure.},

abstract = {Pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection of C57BL/6 mice is an established model of a chronic pulmonary fungal infection accompanied by an "allergic" response (T2) to the infection, i.e., a model of an allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Our objective was to determine whether IFN-gamma plays a role in regulating the pulmonary T2 immune response in C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice. Long-term pulmonary fungistasis was lost in IFN-gamma knockout (KO) mice, resulting in an increased pulmonary burden of fungi at wk 3. IFN-gamma was required for the early influx of leukocytes into the lungs but was not required later in the infection. By wk 3, eosinophil and macrophage numbers were elevated in the absence of IFN-gamma. The inducible NO synthase to arginase ratio was lower in the lungs of IFN-gamma KO mice and the macrophages had increased numbers of intracellular cryptococci and YM1 crystals, indicative of alternatively activated macrophages in these mice. There was evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in both wild-type and IFN-gamma KO mice by 5 wk postinfection. IFN-gamma production was not required for the development of T2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) producing cells in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes or induction of an IgE response. At a number of time points, T2 cytokine production was enhanced in IFN-gamma KO mice. Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma, C57BL/6 mice develop an augmented allergic response to C. neoformans, including enhanced generation of alternatively activated macrophages, which is accompanied by a switch from a chronic to a progressive pulmonary cryptococcal infection.},

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-13 is a major inducer of fibrosis in many chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. In studies of the mechanisms underlying such induction, we found that IL-13 induces transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 in macrophages through a two-stage process involving, first, the induction of a receptor formerly considered to function only as a decoy receptor, IL-13R2. Such induction requires IL-13 (or IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. Second, it involves IL-13 signaling through IL-13R2 to activate an AP-1 variant containing c-jun and Fra-2, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter. In vivo, we found that prevention of IL-13R2 expression reduced production of TGF-1 in oxazolone-induced colitis and that prevention of IL-13R2 expression, Il13ra2 gene silencing or blockade of IL-13R2 signaling led to marked downregulation of TGF-1 production and collagen deposition in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. These data suggest that IL-13R2 signaling during prolonged inflammation is an important therapeutic target for the prevention of TGF-1–mediated fibrosis.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an ubiquitous, saprophytic mould that forms and releases airborne conidia which are inhaled by humans on a daily basis. When the immune system is compromised (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy prior to organ transplantation) or there is pre-existing pulmonary malfunction (e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB lesions), A. fumigatus exploits weaknesses in the host defenses which can result in the development of saphrophytic, allergic or invasive aspergillosis. If not effectively eliminated by the innate immune response, conidia germinate and form invasive hyphae which can penetrate pulmonary tissues. The innate immune response to A. fumigatus is stage-specific and various components of the host's defenses are recruited to challenge the different cellular forms of the pathogen. In immunocompetent hosts, anatomical barriers (e.g. the mucociliary elevator) and professional phagocytes such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils prevent the development of aspergillosis by inhibiting the growth of conidia and hyphae. The recognition of inhaled conidia by AM leads to the intracellular degradation of the spores and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators which recruit neutrophils to assist in fungal clearance. During the later stages of infection, dendritic cells activate a protective A. fumigatus-specific adaptive immune response which is driven by Th1 CD4(+) T cells.},

Objectives To explore the value of serum metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 7 levels in the differential diagnosis of IPF with other ILD. Methods MMP-1/7 serum levels were measured using Luminex xMAP technology in 139 patients- 47 IPF, 36 non-IPF Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), 14 idiopathic Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (iNSIP), 29 secondary NSIP (secNSIP), 13 stage IV sarcoidosis- and 20 healthy controls, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results MMP-1 was significantly higher in IPF than non-IPF UIP (P =.042) and sarcoidosis (P =.027). MMP-7 was significantly higher in IPF than controls (P {\textless}.001), non-IPF UIP (P =.003), secNSIP (P {\textless}.001), and sarcoidosis (P {\textless}.001). The Area Under the Curve for IPF versus other ILD was 0.63 (95{\%}CI, 0.53-0.73) for MMP-1, 0.73 (95{\%}CI, 0.65-0.81) for MMP-7, and 0.74 (95{\%}CI, 0.66-0.82) for MMP-1/MMP-7 combined. Sensitivity and specificity for MMP-7 cutoff = 3.91 ng/mL was 72.3{\%} and 66.3{\%}, respectively, Positive Predictive Values = 52.3{\%} and Negative Predictive Values = 82.4{\%}. Conclusions MMP-1 and particularly MMP-7 serum levels were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF UIP, the main entity in differential diagnosis. The value of these biomarkers as additional tools in a multidisciplinary approach to IPF diagnosis needs to be considered and further explored.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Animal models have suggested that CCR2-dependent signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, but global blockade of CCL2 failed to improve the clinical course of patients with lung fibrosis. However, as levels of CCR2+CD4+T cells in paediatric lung fibrosis had previously been found to be increased, correlating with clinical symptoms, we hypothesised that distinct CCR2+cell populations might either increase or decrease disease pathogenesis depending on their subtype. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of CCR2+CD4+T cells in experimental lung fibrosis and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrosis. METHODS Pulmonary CCR2+CD4+T cells were analysed using flow cytometry and mRNA profiling, followed by in silico pathway analysis, in vitro assays and adoptive transfer experiments. RESULTS Frequencies of CCR2+CD4+T cells were increased in experimental fibrosis-specifically the CD62L-CD44+effector memory T cell phenotype, displaying a distinct chemokine receptor profile. mRNA profiling of isolated CCR2+CD4+T cells from fibrotic lungs suggested immune regulatory functions, a finding that was confirmed in vitro using suppressor assays. Importantly, adoptive transfer of CCR2+CD4+T cells attenuated fibrosis development. The results were partly corroborated in patients with lung fibrosis, by showing higher percentages of Foxp3+CD25+cells within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CCR2+CD4+T cells as compared with CCR2-CD4+T cells. CONCLUSION Pulmonary CCR2+CD4+T cells are immunosuppressive, and could attenuate lung inflammation and fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies completely abrogating CCR2-dependent signalling will therefore also eliminate cell populations with protective roles in fibrotic lung disease. This emphasises the need for a detailed understanding of the functions of immune cell subsets in fibrotic lung disease.},

abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease characterized by a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell-dominated alveolitis. As a role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been discussed, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be involved in the initiation of a first immune reaction. We analyzed expression and functional relevance of several TLRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. In parallel, we determined the release of C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 by BAL cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 1 and 2, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR9 expression by BAL cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Chemokine release was measured in BAL cell culture supernatants by ELISA. We found increased TLR9 mRNA expression in patients with sarcoidosis with chest X-ray type I and II and TLR9 protein expression in BAL cells from patients with chest X-ray type II and III. Stimulation with CpG nucleotides increased CXCL10 release by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis type II significantly compared with control subjects or other patients with sarcoidosis. In contrast, no increase in TNF, IL-12p40, or CXCL8 was detected. Spontaneous release of CXCL10, but not CXCL9 or CXCL11, by cultured BAL cells was also highest in cells from patients with chest X-ray type II. We found a significant association between TLR9 expression and CD4(+) lymphocytes in BAL. Our data demonstrate that TLR9 ligands may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis via induction of CXCL10 release in the alveolar macrophages.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

abstract = {Summary Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or differentiated in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic polarization conditions. Computational analysis relates a spectrum of cellular states in vivo to in-vitro-differentiated Th17 cells and unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four new genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso, and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while potentially sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary sarcoidosis are typical interstitial lung diseases with unknown etiology that cause lethal lung damages. There are notable differences between these two pulmonary disorders, although they do share some similarities. Gene expression profiles have been reported independently, but differences on the transcriptional level between these two entities have not been investigated.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS/RESULTS: All expression data of lung tissue samples for IPF and sarcoidosis were from published datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. After cross platform normalization, the merged sample data were grouped together and were subjected to statistical analysis for finding discriminate genes. Gene enrichments with their corresponding functions were analyzed by the online analysis engine "Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery" (DAVID) 6.7, and genes interactions and functional networks were further analyzed by STRING 9.0 and Cytoscape 3.0.0 Beta1. One hundred and thirty signature genes could potentially differentiate one disease state from another. Compared with normal lung tissue, tissue affected by IPF and sarcoidosis displayed similar signatures that concentrated on proliferation and differentiation. Distinctly expressed genes that could distinguish IPF from sarcoidosis are more enriched in processes of cilium biogenesis or degradation and regulating T cell activations. Key discriminative network modules involve aspects of bone morphogenetic protein receptor two (BMPR2) related and v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene (MYB) related proliferation.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first attempt to examine the transcriptional regulation of IPF and sarcoidosis across different studies based on different working platforms. Groups of significant genes were found to clearly distinguish one condition from the other. While IPF and sarcoidosis share notable similarities in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, remarkable differences between the diseases were found at the transcription level, suggesting that the two diseases are regulated by overlapping yet distinctive transcriptional networks.},

abstract = {Hundreds of clinical studies have demonstrated associations between the human microbiome and disease, yet fundamental questions remain on how we can generalize this knowledge. Results from individual studies can be inconsistent, and comparing published data is further complicated by a lack of standard processing and analysis methods. Here we introduce the MicrobiomeHD database, which includes 28 published case–control gut microbiome studies spanning ten diseases. We perform a cross-disease meta-analysis of these studies using standardized methods. We find consistent patterns characterizing disease-associated microbiome changes. Some diseases are associated with over 50 genera, while most show only 10–15 genus-level changes. Some diseases are marked by the presence of potentially pathogenic microbes, whereas others are characterized by a depletion of health-associated bacteria. Furthermore, we show that about half of genera associated with individual studies are bacteria that respond to more than one disease. Thus, many associations found in case–control studies are likely not disease-specific but rather part of a non-specific, shared response to health and disease.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

abstract = {Given the importance of monocytes in pathogenesis of infectious and other inflammatory disorders, delineating functional and phenotypic characterization of monocyte subsets has emerged as a critical requirement. Although human monocytes have been subdivided into three different populations based on surface expression of CD14 and CD16, published reports suffer from contradictions with respect to subset phenotypes and function. This has been attributed to discrepancies in reliable gating strategies for flow cytometric characterization and purification protocols contributing to significant changes in receptor expression. By using a combination of multicolour flow cytometry and a high-dimensional automated clustering algorithm to confirm robustness of gating strategy and analysis of ex-vivo activation of whole blood with LPS we demonstrate the following: a. 'Classical' monocytes are phagocytic with no inflammatory attributes, b. 'Non-classical' subtype display 'inflammatory' characteristics on activation and display properties for antigen presentation and c. 'Intermediate' subtype that constitutes a very small percentage in circulation (under physiological conditions) appear to be transitional monocytes that display both phagocytic and inflammatory function. Analysis of blood from patients with Sepsis, a pathogen driven acute inflammatory disease and Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disorder validated the broad conclusions drawn in the study.},

abstract = {Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived, circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells that play a role in several fibrotic disorders, including lung fibrosis. They are attracted to injured tissue by various chemokines. It is likely that fibrocytes play a detrimental role in tissue homeostasis and promote fibrosis, although this paradigm needs further confirmation. This would make fibrocytes a possible novel treatment target for fibrotic disorders. Fibrocytes also have some potential as a biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other diseases, but the promising preliminary data from single centre studies still require independent validation. Despite several, as yet, unresolved issues, it has become clear that fibrocytes are more than an incidental finding in lung injury and repair, and may hold great promise for the future of IPF management.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF and whether components of this signature may serve as biomarkers for disease presence and progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the concentrations of 49 proteins in the plasma of 74 patients with IPF and in the plasma of 53 control individuals. We identified a combinatorial signature of five proteins-MMP7, MMP1, MMP8, IGFBP1, and TNFRSF1A-that was sufficient to distinguish patients from controls with a sensitivity of 98.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 92.7{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 98.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 89.9{\%}-100{\%}). Increases in MMP1 and MMP7 were also observed in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from IPF patients. MMP7 and MMP1 plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis and distinguished IPF compared to subacute/chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease that may mimic IPF, with a sensitivity of 96.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 81.0{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 87.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 72.6{\%}-95.7{\%}). We verified our results in an independent validation cohort composed of patients with IPF, familial pulmonary fibrosis, subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD), as well as with control individuals. MMP7 and MMP1 concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to controls in this cohort. Furthermore, MMP7 concentrations were elevated in patients with subclinical ILD and negatively correlated with percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC{\%}) and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments provide the first evidence for a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF to our knowledge. The two main components of this signature, MMP7 and MMP1, are overexpressed in the lung microenvironment and distinguish IPF from other chronic lung diseases. Additionally, increased MMP7 concentration may be indicative of asymptomatic ILD and reflect disease progression.},

abstract = {The initial stimulus for inflammatory cell recruitment and the mechanisms responsible for the perpetuation and evolution of chronic inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. Although interleukin (IL)-13, a Th2 cytokine, has been shown to have direct effects on fibroblasts that support fibroproliferation, it is also a potent inducer of a novel CC chemokine, C10, which is chemotactic for mononuclear phagocytes. The macrophage/mononuclear phagocyte has been shown to have a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, serving as an important source of growth factors that regulate extracellular matrix synthesis. In this study we demonstrate that IL-13 and C10 are elevated in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Neutralization of IL-13, but not IL-4, attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and levels of C10, suggesting that IL-13 has an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. IL-13 is a potent inducer of C10 in vivo, and neutralization of C10 attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and intrapulmonary macrophage numbers. This suggests that IL-13 has a role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis that is independent of its direct effect on fibroblasts and is evidence for an interaction between Th2 cytokines and specific CC chemokines.},

@article{Bhatia2011,
abstract = {The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with chronic diseases such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Because of constant exposure to this fungus, it is critical for the host to exercise an immediate and decisive immune response to clear fungal spores to ward off disease. In this study, we observed that rapidly after infection by A. fumigatus, alveolar macrophages predominantly express Arginase 1 (Arg1), a key marker of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). The macrophages were also found to express Ym1 and CD206 that are also expressed by AAMs but not NOS2, which is expressed by classically activated macrophages. The expression of Arg1 was reduced in the absence of the known signaling axis, IL-4Ralpha/STAT6, for AAM development. While both Dectin-1 and TLR expressed on the cell surface have been shown to sense A. fumigatus, fungus-induced Arg1 expression in CD11c(+) alveolar macrophages was not dependent on either Dectin-1 or the adaptor MyD88 that mediates intracellular signaling by most TLRs. Alveolar macrophages from WT mice efficiently phagocytosed fungal conidia, but those from mice deficient in Dectin-1 showed impaired fungal uptake. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate-filled liposomes increased fungal burden in infected mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that alveolar macrophages, which predominantly acquire an AAM phenotype following A. fumigatus infection, have a protective role in defense against this fungus.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable complex genetic disorder that is associated with sequence changes in 7 genes (MUC5B, TERT, TERC, RTEL1, PARN, SFTPC, and SFTPA2) and with variants in at least 11 novel loci. We have previously found that 1) a common gain-of-function promoter variant in MUC5B rs35705950 is the strongest risk factor (genetic and otherwise), accounting for 30-35{\%} of the risk of developing IPF, a disease that was previously considered idiopathic; 2) the MUC5B promoter variant can potentially be used to identify individuals with preclinical pulmonary fibrosis and is predictive of radiologic progression of preclinical pulmonary fibrosis; and 3) MUC5B may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis with MUC5B message and protein expressed in bronchiolo-alveolar epithelia of IPF and the characteristic IPF honeycomb cysts. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that excessive production of MUC5B either enhances injury due to reduced mucociliary clearance or impedes repair consequent to disruption of normal regenerative mechanisms in the distal lung. In aggregate, these novel considerations should have broad impact, resulting in specific etiologic targets, early detection of disease, and novel biologic pathways for use in the design of future intervention, prevention, and mechanistic studies of IPF.},

abstract = {The analysis of modular gene co-expression networks is a well-established method commonly used for discovering the systems-level functionality of genes. In addition, these studies provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant molecular pathways underlying different diseases and conditions. In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-use Bioconductor package named CEMiTool that unifies the discovery and the analysis of co-expression modules. Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania, revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. The CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.},

Several clinical disorders can precipitate ARDS, including pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, and major trauma. Physiologically, ARDS is characterized by increased permeability pulmonary edema, severe arterial hypoxemia, and impaired carbon dioxide excretion. Based on both experimental and clinical studies, progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis and the resolution of lung injury, including the contribution of environmental and genetic factors. Improved sur- vival has been achieved with the use of lung-protective ventilation. Future progress will depend on developing novel therapeutics that can facilitate and enhance lung repair.},

abstract = {Macrophage activation is associated with profound transcriptional reprogramming. Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processesremain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages. This resource serves as a framework for future research into regulation of macrophage activation in health and disease. copy; 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many diseases accompanied by chronic inflammation are connected with dysregulated activation of macrophage subpopulations. Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO2-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1–5 min) experiments. We discovered that NO2-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO2-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO2-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO2-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO2-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO2-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

Further studies were performed on samples from patients with IPF.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Depletion of lung macrophages during fibrogenesis reduced pulmonary fibrosis as measured by lung collagen (P = 0.0079); fibrosis score (P = 0.0051); and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for surrogate markers of fibrosis Col1 (P = 0.0083) and a-smooth muscle actin (P = 0.0349). There was an associated reduction in markers of the profibrotic alternative macrophage activation phenotype, Ym1 (P = 0.0179), and Arginase 1. The alternative macrophage marker CD163 was expressed on lung macrophages from patients with IPF. Depletion of Ly6Chi circulating monocytes reduced pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.0052) and the number of Ym1- positive alternatively activated lung macrophages (P = 0.0310). Their adoptive transfer during fibrogenesis exacerbated fibrosis (P = 0.0304); however, adoptively transferred CD45.1 Ly6Chi cells were not found in the lungs of recipient CD45.2 mice.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of circulating monocytes and lung macrophages during pulmonary fibrosis, and emphasize the importance of the alternatively activated macrophage phenotype. We show that Ly6Chi monocytes facilitate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, but are not obviously engrafted into lungs thereafter. Finally, we provide empirical data to suggest that macrophages may have a resolution-promoting role during the reversible phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {The immune system provides an essential defence against invading pathogens. However, bacteria have evolved numerous strategies to overcome this defence, many of which facilitate systemic dissemination of the pathogen. Nevertheless, the host has evolved many mechanisms to detect and protect against pathogens in the vasculature. Recent studies using new imaging approaches and new mouse models are revealing previously unappreciated functions of this intravascular aspect of the immune system. In this Review, we summarize recent work in this field, highlighting in vivo imaging studies that examine the behaviour of both the immune system and bacteria in the highly dynamic microvasculature.},

Personalized medicine focuses on the use of the individual's molecular and 'omic' (i.e., genomic, epigenomic and proteomic) information to direct more efficient and cost-effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, outcome prediction and treatment of diseases. In this review, we describe the use and promise of applying 'omic' technologies to the familial and sporadic forms of IPF as a means to personalize diagnosis and outcome prediction in IPF.

abstract = {Mouse myeloma NS0 cells widely used in hybridoma technology lack the expression of a major stress protein Hsp70 which is the principal component of the basic cellular defense mechanism. These cells rapidly undergo apoptosis at the late-stationary phase of batch culture following nutrient exhaustion. Since Hsp70 was recently demonstrated to protect cells against numerous apoptotic stimuli, the aim of the present study was to examine the protective potential of the protein expression in engineered myeloma NS0 cells and in resulting hybridomas. Myeloma cells were transfected with the hsp70 gene under beta-actin gene promoter. To imitate harmful conditions that hybridoma or myeloma cells often experience when cultivated in large scale for an antibody production, NS0(wt) and NS0(hsp70) cell cultures were maintained without changing the medium for a few days, and the expression of apoptotic markers has been studied. It was found that long-term cultivation induced apoptosis in original cells manifested by typical nuclei fragmentation, DNA ladders and activation of caspase-3. In contrast, in transfected cells under the same conditions the outcome of apoptosis was postponed for 24 hours. Most relevant was that the fusion of transfected myeloma cells with immune splenocytes resulted in twofold hybridomas output compared with wild-type fusion partner. Almost half of the hybridomas continued to be hsp70-positive and maintained higher robustness in culture. The level of monoclonal antibodies production by hybridoma cells obtained with the use of NS0(wt) and NS0(hsp70) was similar, however, the secreted product was better preserved in culture supernatants of Hsp70-positive cells. It is concluded that transfection of mouse myeloma cells with the hsp70 gene can be a novel means to increase hybridoma yield and reduce the sensitivity of myeloma and hybridoma cells to culture conditions insults accompanying monoclonal antibody production.},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively).

abstract = {Understanding the functional implications of changes in gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

Distinct from the simple M1/M2 dichotomy initially proposed, extensive diversity of macrophage phenotypes have been extensively demonstrated as characteristic features of monocyte-macrophage differentiation, highlighting the difficulty of defining complex profiles by a limited number of genes. Since the description of macrophage activation is currently contentious and confusing, the generation of a simple and reliable framework to categorize major Mϕ phenotypes in the context of complex clinical conditions would be extremely relevant to unravel different roles played by these cells in pathophysiological scenarios. In the current study, we integrated transcriptome data using bioinformatics tools to generate two macrophage molecular signatures. We validated our signatures in in vitro experiments and in clinical samples. More importantly, we were able to attribute prognostic and predictive values to components of our signatures. Our study provides a framework to guide the interrogation of macrophage phenotypes in the context of health and disease. The approach described here could be used to propose new biomarkers for diagnosis in diverse clinical settings including dengue infections, asthma and sepsis resolution.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of identifying differentially expressed groups of genes from a microarray experiment. The groups of genes are ex-ternally defined, for example, sets of gene pathways derived from biological databases. Our starting point is the interesting Gene Set Enrichment Analy-sis (GSEA) procedure of Subramanian et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 15545–15550]. We study the problem in some generality and propose two potential improvements to GSEA: the maxmean statistic for summarizing gene-sets, and restandardization for more accurate inferences. We discuss a variety of examples and extensions, including the use of gene-set scores for class predictions. We also describe a new R language package GSA that im-plements our ideas. 1. Introduction. We discuss the problem of identifying differentially ex-pressed groups of genes from a set of microarray experiments. In the usual situation we have N genes measured on n microarrays, under two different ex-perimental conditions, such as control and treatment. The number of genes N is usually large, say, at least a few thousand, while the number samples n is smaller, say, a hundred or fewer. This problem is an example of multiple hypothesis testing with a large number of tests, one that often arises in genomic and proteomic ap-plications, and also in signal processing. We focus mostly on the gene expression problem, but our proposed methods are more widely applicable. Most approaches start by computing a two-sample t-statistic z j for each gene. Genes having t-statistics larger than a pre-defined cutoff (in absolute value) are declared significant, and then the family-wise error rate or false discovery rate of the resulting gene list is assessed by comparing the tail area from a null distribution of the statistic. This null distribution is derived from data permutations, or from asymptotic theory. In an interesting and useful paper, Subramanian et al. (2005) proposed a method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for assessing the significance of pre-defined gene-sets, rather than individual genes. The gene-sets can be derived from different sources, for example, the sets of genes representing biological pathways},

To extract maximum value from the accumulating mass of publicly available cancer gene expression data, methods are needed to evaluate, integrate, and intervalidate multiple datasets. Here we demonstrate a statistical model for performing meta-analysis of independent microarray datasets. Implementation of this model revealed that four prostate cancer gene expression datasets shared significantly similar results, independent of the method and technology used (i.e., spotted cDNA versus oligonucleotide). This interstudy cross-validation approach generated a cohort of genes that were consistently and significantly dysregulated in prostate cancer. Bioinformatic investigation of these genes revealed a synchronous network of transcriptional regulation in the polyamine and purine biosynthesis pathways. Beyond the specific implications for prostate cancer, this work establishes a much-needed model for the evaluation, cross-validation, and comparison of multiple cancer profiling studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronically progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Previously, we have demonstrated the selective upregulation of the macrophage-derived chemokine CCL22 and the thymus activation-regulated chemokine CCL17 among chemokines, in a rat model of radiation pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis and preliminarily observed an increase in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid CCL22 levels of IPF patients. METHODS: We examined the expression of CCR4, a specific receptor for CCL22 and CCL17, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cells, as well as the levels of CCL22 and CCL17, to elucidate their pathophysiological roles in pulmonary fibrosis. We also studied their immunohistochemical localization. RESULTS: BAL fluid CCL22 and CCL17 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF than those with collagen vascular diseases and healthy volunteers, and there was a significant correlation between the levels of CCL22 and CCL17 in patients with IPF. CCL22 levels in the BAL fluid did not correlate with the total cell numbers, alveolar lymphocytes, or macrophages in BAL fluid. However, the CCL22 levels significantly correlated with the numbers of CCR4-expressing alveolar macrophages. By immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis, localization of CCL22 and CCR4 to CD68-positive alveolar macrophages as well as that of CCL17 to hyperplastic epithelial cells were shown. Clinically, CCL22 BAL fluid levels inversely correlated with DLco/VA values in IPF patients. CONCLUSION: We speculated that locally overexpressed CCL22 may induce lung dysfunction through recruitment and activation of CCR4-positive alveolar macrophages.},

abstract = {The lack of a method for demonstrating the presence of Treponema pallidum by growth necessitates the use of alternative methods. Traditionally, these methods are divided into direct detection methods (animal inoculation, dark-field microscopy, etc.) and serologic tests for the presence of patient antibody against T. pallidum. Serologic methods are further divided into two classes. One class, the nontreponemal tests, detects antibodies to lipoidal antigens present in either the host or T. pallidum; examples are the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma reagin and tests. Reactivity in these tests generally indicates host tissue damage that may not be specific for syphilis. Because these tests are easy and inexpensive to perform, they are commonly used for screening, and with proper clinical signs they are suggestive of syphilis. The other class of test, the treponemal tests, uses specific treponemal antigens. Confirmation of infection requires a reactive treponemal test. Examples of the treponemal tests are the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. These tests are more expensive and complicated to perform than the nontreponemal tests. On the horizon are a number of direct antigen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PCR techniques. Several of these techniques have shown promise in clinical trials for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis that are presently difficult to diagnose.},

abstract = {The first steps in the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data are usually to map the reads to a reference genome and then to count reads by gene, by exon or by exon-exon junction. These two steps are at once the most common and also typically the most expensive computational steps in an RNA-seq analysis. These steps are typically undertaken using Unix command-line or Python software tools, even when downstream analysis is to be undertaken using R. We present Rsubread, a Bioconductor software package that provides high-performance alignment and counting functions for RNA-seq reads. Rsubread provides the ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It has no software dependencies other than R itself. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to the popular non-R tools TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq. We also compare to counting functions provided in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We show that Rsubread is faster, uses less memory and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Combining multiple microarray datasets increases sample size and leads to improved reproducibility in identification of informative genes and subsequent clinical prediction. Although microarrays have increased the rate of genomic data collection, sample size is still a major issue when identifying informative genetic biomarkers. Because of this, feature selection methods often suffer from false discoveries, resulting in poorly performing predictive models. We develop a simple meta-analysis-based feature selection method that captures the knowledge in each individual dataset and combines the results using a simple rank average. In a comprehensive study that measures robustness in terms of clinical application (i.e., breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer), microarray platform heterogeneity, and classifier (i.e., logistic regression, diagonal LDA, and linear SVM), we compare the rank average meta-analysis method to five other meta-analysis methods. Results indicate that rank average meta-analysis consistently performs well compared to five other meta-analysis methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Monocytes are highly plastic and heterogeneous, and change their functional phenotype in response to environmental stimulation. Evidence from murine and human studies has suggested that monocytosis can be an indicator of various inflammatory diseases. Monocytes can differentiate into inflammatory or anti-inflammatory subsets. Upon tissue damage or infection, monocytes are rapidly recruited to the tissue, where they can differentiate into tissue macrophages or dendritic cells. Given the rapid progress in monocyte research from broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases, there is a need to summarize our knowledge in monocyte heterogeneity and its impact in human disease. In this review, we describe the current understanding of heterogeneity of human and murine monocytes, the function of distinct subsets of monocytes, and a potential mechanism for monocyte differentiation. We emphasize that inflammatory monocyte subsets are valuable biomarkers for inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {Many diseases accompanied by chronic inflammation are connected with dysregulated activation of macrophage subpopulations. Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO2-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1–5 min) experiments. We discovered that NO2-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO2-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO2-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO2-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO2-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO2-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.},

abstract = {Introduction: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has prognostic value in various pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We determined the individual prognostic accuracy of distance walked and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT in patients with IPF. We defined a new composite index, the distance-saturation product (DSP), which is the product of distance walked and lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk test. We compared the performance of the DSP to the individual 6MWT parameters in predicting mortality. Methods: We evaluated pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk parameters and the DSP between survivors and non-survivors. The ability of each measure to discriminate outcomes was determined by receiver operator curves. Results: 81 patients (48 survivors, 33 non-survivors) were included. Pulmonary function tests were similar and did not correlate with survival. Desaturation was greater (89.4{\%} versus 83.7{\%}, P {\textless}0.001) and distance walked was lower (406.9 versus 181.3 m, P = 0.005) in non-survivors. The DSP was significantly lower among non-survivors (364.8 versus 153.5 m{\%}, P {\textless}0.001) and predicted mortality more accurately than either individual 6MWT component (P = 0.035 versus desaturation, P = 0.040 versus distance). A DSP {\textless}200 m{\%} was associated with a seven-fold greater risk of 12-month mortality and an 18.0{\%} shorter median survival compared with a DSP{\textgreater}200 m{\%} (P {\textless}0.001). Discussion: Each component of the 6-min walk independently predicted mortality in IPF with greater accuracy than spirometry. However, a composite of both parameters, the DSP, provides slightly greater accuracy and represents a novel measure for assessing survival in patients with IPF.},

Patients were randomised to carlumab (1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1, 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1, or 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of percentage change in forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary endpoints were time to disease progression, absolute change in FVC, relative change in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score.Due to a pre-planned, unfavourable interim benefit–risk analysis, dosing was suspended. The rate of percentage change in FVC showed no treatment effect (placebo −0.582{\%}, 1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −0.533{\%}, 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −0.799{\%} and 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −0.470{\%}; p=0.261). All active treatment groups showed a greater decline in FVC (1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −290 mL, 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −370 mL and 15 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1 −320 mL) compared with placebo (−130 mL). No effect on disease progression, DLCO, infection rates or mortality was observed. SGRQ scores showed a nonsignificant trend toward worsening with active treatment. Unexpectedly, free CC-chemokine ligand 2 levels were elevated above baseline at both 24 and 52 weeks.

In this paper, we compare the performance of different competing methods to model data with zero inflated features through extensive simulations and application to a microbiome study. These methods include standard parametric and non-parametric models, hurdle models, and zero inflated models. We examine varying degrees of zero inflation, with or without dispersion in the count component, as well as different magnitude and direction of the covariate effect on structural zeros and the count components. We focus on the assessment of type I error, power to detect the overall covariate effect, measures of model fit, and bias and effectiveness of parameter estimations. We also evaluate the abilities of model selection strategies using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Vuong test to identify the correct model. The simulation studies show that hurdle and zero inflated models have well controlled type I errors, higher power, better goodness of fit measures, and are more accurate and efficient in the parameter estimation. Besides that, the hurdle models have similar goodness of fit and parameter estimation for the count component as their corresponding zero inflated models. However, the estimation and interpretation of the parameters for the zero components differs, and hurdle models are more stable when structural zeros are absent. We then discuss the model selection strategy for zero inflated data and implement it in a gut microbiome study of {\textgreater}400 independent subjects.},

Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processesremain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages.

abstract = {We have previously shown that mice that are genetically deficient in the CCR2 gene (CCR2-/- mice) are protected from fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced lung fibrosis. Protection from fibrosis correlated with impaired recruitment of fibrocytes (bone marrow-derived cells, which share both leukocyte and mesenchymal markers). There are three ligands for CCR2 in the mouse: CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12. CCL2 and CCL12 are both elevated in the lung after FITC injury, but with different kinetics. CCL2 is maximal at Day 1 and absent by Day 7 after FITC. In contrast, CCL12 peaks at Day 3, but remains elevated through Day 21 after FITC. We now demonstrate that while CCR2-/- mice are protected from FITC-induced fibrosis, CCL2-/- mice are not. CCL2-/- mice are able to recruit fibrocytes to FITC-injured airspaces, unlike CCR2-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of CCR2-expressing fibrocytes augments FITC-induced fibrosis in both wild-type and CCR2-/- mice, suggesting that these cells play a pathogenic role in the disease process. Both CCL2 and CCL12 are chemotactic for fibrocytes. However, neutralization of CCL12 in wild-type mice significantly protects from FITC-induced fibrosis, whereas neutralization of CCL2 was less effective. Thus, CCL12 is likely the CCR2 ligand responsible for driving fibroproliferation in the mouse. As murine CCL12 is homologous to human CCL2, we suggest that the pathobiology of murine CCL12 in fibroproliferation may correlate to human CCL2 biology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The initial next-generation sequencing technologies produced reads of 25 or 36 bp, and only from a single-end of the library sequence. Currently, it is possible to reliably produce 300 bp paired-end sequences for RNA expression analysis. While read lengths have consistently increased, people have assumed that longer reads are more informative and that paired-end reads produce better results than single-end reads. We used paired-end 101 bp reads and trimmed them to simulate different read lengths, and also separated the pairs to produce single-end reads. For each read length and paired status, we evaluated differential expression levels between two standard samples and compared the results to those obtained by qPCR.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: We found that, with the exception of 25 bp reads, there is little difference for the detection of differential expression regardless of the read length. Once single-end reads are at a length of 50 bp, the results do not change substantially for any level up to, and including, 100 bp paired-end. However, splice junction detection significantly improves as the read length increases with 100 bp paired-end showing the best performance. We performed the same analysis on two ENCODE samples and found consistent results confirming that our conclusions have broad application.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: A researcher could save substantial resources by using 50 bp single-end reads for differential expression analysis instead of using longer reads. However, splicing detection is unquestionably improved by paired-end and longer reads. Therefore, an appropriate read length should be used based on the final goal of the study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 the American Physiological Society Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal disease that involves the remodeling of the distal airspace and the lung parenchyma, which results in compromised gas exchange. The median survival time once diagnosed is less than three years. Interleukin (IL)-13 has been shown to play a role in a number of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. IL-13 modulates its effector functions via a complex receptor system that includes the IL-4 receptor (R) {\$}\alpha{\$}, IL-13R{\$}\alpha{\$}1, and the IL-13R{\$}\alpha{\$}2. IL-13R{\$}\alpha{\$}1 binds IL-13 with low affinity, yet, when it forms a complex with IL-4{\$}\alpha{\$}, it binds with much higher affinity, inducing the effector functions of IL-13. IL-13R{\$}\alpha{\$}2 binds IL-13 with high affinity but has a short cytoplasmic tail and has been shown to act as a nonsignaling decoy receptor. Transfection of fibroblasts and epithelial cells with IL- 13R{\$}\alpha{\$}2 inhibited the IL-13 induction of soluble collagen, TGF-{\$}\alpha{\$}, and CCL 17.

abstract = {Macrophage-specific expression of Arginase-1 is commonly believed to promote inflammation, fibrosis, and wound healing by enhancing L-proline, polyamine, and Th2 cytokine production. Here, however, we show that macrophage-specific Arg1 functions as an inhibitor of inflammation and fibrosis following infection with the Th2-inducing pathogen Schistosoma mansoni. Although susceptibility to infection was not affected by the conditional deletion of Arg1 in macrophages, Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice died at an accelerated rate. The mortality was not due to acute Th1/NOS2-mediated hepatotoxicity or endotoxemia. Instead, granulomatous inflammation, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension increased in infected Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice. Similar findings were obtained with Arg1(flox/flox);Tie2cre mice, which delete Arg1 in all macrophage populations. Production of Th2 cytokines increased in the infected Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre mice, and unlike alternatively activated wild-type macrophages, Arg1(-/flox);LysMcre macrophages failed to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro, providing an underlying mechanism for the exacerbated Th2 pathology. The suppressive activity of Arg1-expressing macrophages was independent of IL-10 and TGF-beta1. However, when exogenous L-arginine was provided, T cell proliferation was restored, suggesting that Arg1-expressing macrophages deplete arginine, which is required to sustain CD4(+) T cell responses. These data identify Arg1 as the essential suppressive mediator of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) and demonstrate that Arg1-expressing macrophages function as suppressors rather than inducers of Th2-dependent inflammation and fibrosis.},

METHODS: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize all available evidence pertinent to our questions. The evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied, and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists. RESULTS: After considering the confidence in effect estimates, the importance of outcomes studied, desirable and undesirable consequences of treatment, cost, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention, and implications to health equity, recommendations were made for or against specific treatment interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations in favor of or against treatment interventions for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

Although human monocytes have been subdivided into three different populations based on surface expression of CD14 and CD16, published reports suffer from contradictions with respect to subset phenotypes and function. This has been attributed to discrepancies in reliable gating strategies for flow cytometric characterization and purification protocols contributing to significant changes in receptor expression. By using a combination of multicolour flow cytometry and a high-dimensional automated clustering algorithm to confirm robustness of gating strategy and analysis of ex-vivo activation of whole blood with LPS we demonstrate the following: a. 'Classical' monocytes are phagocytic with no inflammatory attributes, b. 'Non-classical' subtype display 'inflammatory' characteristics on activation and display properties for antigen presentation and c. 'Intermediate' subtype that constitutes a very small percentage in circulation (under physiological conditions) appear to be transitional monocytes that display both phagocytic and inflammatory function. Analysis of blood from patients with Sepsis, a pathogen driven acute inflammatory disease and Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disorder validated the broad conclusions drawn in the study.},

They may be polarized according to various stimuli, which subsequently subdivide them into distinct populations. Macrophages with inflammatory activity function mainly during pathological context, while those with regulatory activity control inflammation and also remodel the repairing process. Here, we propose to review and to present a concise discuss on the role of different components during tissue repair, including those related to innate immune receptors and metabolic modifications. The scar formation is directly related to the degree of inflammation, but also with the appearance of M2 macrophages. In spite of greater numbers of macrophages in the fibrotic phase, regulatory macrophages present some characteristics related to promotion of fibrosis but also with the control of scar formation. These regulatory macrophages present an oxidative metabolism, and differ from the initial inflammatory macrophages, which in turn, present a glycolytic characteristic, which allow regulatory ones to optimize the oxygen consumption and minimizing their ROS production. We will emphasize the difference in macrophage subpopulations and the origin and plasticity of these cells during fibrotic processes.},

abstract = {Bleomycin induces a transient lung fibrosis in mice that has been used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our aim was to determine a sensitive method for assessing lung function in bleomycin treated mice that correlated with the degree of lung fibrosis as measured by collagen immunohistochemistry. Bleomycin (2 U/kg) or saline was intratracheally microsprayed to male C57BL/6 mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Lung function (single compartment model, constant phase model, and work of breathing) was assessed using the flexiVent system, and after euthanasia lungs were inflated with formalin in situ for histological analysis. The lung fibrosis histopathology score for the bleomycin treated animals on day 21 was indicative of mild-to-moderate fibrosis (Saline treated control: 0 ± 0, Bleomycin treated: 4.9 ± 0.4). There were at least three large areas of fibrosis in the peribronchial alveolar regions of the lung, but less than 50{\%} of each lung was affected by fibrosis. Although changes in lung function were less obvious, volume normalized dynamic work of breathing measured at 30 ml/kg tidal volume (Saline treated control: 9.2 ± 0.1 J/l, Bleomycin treated: 10.6 ± 0.3 J/l) and the oscillatory mechanics constant phase model parameter tissue elastance (H; Saline treated control: 31 ± 2 cm H2O/ml, Bleomycin treated: 38 ± 3 cm H2O/ml) were significantly increased on day 21. The work of breathing (r = 0.83) correlated slightly better with fibrosis histopathology score than H (r = 0.64). Work of breathing can detect decrements in lung function due to pulmonary fibrosis, correlates well with the amount of collagen in the lungs, and may be a more sensitive quantitative measure of efficacy for drugs being developed to treat pulmonary fibrosis. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Chemokine receptors and their chemokine ligands, key mediators of inflammatory and immune cell trafficking, are involved in the regulation of both physiological and pathological processes in the lung. The discovery that chemokine receptors/chemokines, typically expressed by inflammatory and immune cells, are also expressed in structural lung tissue cells suggests their role in mediating the restoration of lung tissue structure and functions. Thus, chemokine receptors/chemokines contribute not only to inflammatory and immune responses in the lung but also play a critical role in the regulation of lung tissue repair, regeneration, and remodeling. This review aims to summarize current state-of-the-art on chemokine receptors and their ligands in lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma/allergy, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, and lung infection. Furthermore, the therapeutic opportunities of chemokine receptors in aforementioned lung diseases are discussed. The review also aims to delineate the potential contribution of chemokine receptors to the processes leading to repair/regeneration of the lung tissue.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat curable diseases such as germinative tumors and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The major limitation of bleomycin therapy is pulmonary toxicity, which can be life threatening in up to 10{\%} of patients receiving the drug. The mechanism of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP) involves oxidative damage, relative deficiency of the deactivating enzyme bleomycin hydrolase, genetic susceptibility, and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, BIP can progress to lung fibrosis. The diagnosis of BIP is established by the combination of systemic symptoms, radiological and histological findings, and respiratory function tests abnormalities, while other disorders should be excluded. Although the diagnosis and pathophysiology of this disease have been better characterized over the past few years, there is no effective therapy for the disease. In general, the clinical picture is extremely complex. A greater understanding of the BIP pathogenesis may lead to the development of new agents capable of preventing or even treating the injury already present. Physicians who prescribe bleomycin must be aware of the potential pulmonary toxicity, especially in the presence of risk factors. This review will focus on BIP, mainly regarding recent advances and perspectives in diagnosis and treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Human monocytes are commonly defined and discriminated by the extent of their cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, with associated differences in function and phenotype related to the intensity of expression of these markers. With increasing interest into the function and behaviour of monocytes, it is important to have a clear understanding of how differing strategies of analysis can affect results and how different protocols and population backgrounds can affect this highly morphogenic cell type.Using PBMCs from populations with differing ethnicities and histories of parasite exposure we have characterized monocyte phenotype based on intensity of CD14 and CD16 expression. Using the surface markers HLA-DR, CCR2 and CX3CR1, we compared monocyte phenotype between populations and further assessed changes in monocytes with freezing and thawing of PBMCs.Our results reveal that there is a progression of surface marker expression based on intensity of CD14 or CD16 expression, stressing the importance of careful gating of monocyte subtypes. Freezing and thawing of the PBMCs has no effect generally on the monocytes, although it does lead to a decrease in CD16 and CX3CR1 expression. We show that there are differences in the monocyte populations based on ethnicity and history of exposure to the common parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.This study highlights that blood monocytes consist of a continuous population of cells, within which the dominant phenotype may vary dependent on the background of the study population. Comparing results from monocyte studies therefore needs to be done with great care, as ethnic background of donor population, gating strategy and processing of PBMCs may all have an effect on outcome of monocyte phenotype. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the prototype of interstitial lung diseases, has the worst prognosis and is the only interstitial lung disease for which approved pharmacological treatments are available. Despite being considered a rare disease, IPF patients pose major challenges to both physicians and healthcare systems. It is estimated that a large number of IPF patients reside in BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) given their overall total population of approximately 3 billion inhabitants. Nevertheless, the limited availability of chest imaging in BRIC countries is considered a chief obstacle to diagnosis, since high-resolution computed tomography of the chest is the key diagnostic test for IPF. Further, obtaining reliable lung function tests and providing treatment access is difficult in the more rural areas of these countries. However, IPF might represent an opportunity for BRIC countries: the exponentially increasing demand for the enrollment of IPF patients in clinical trials of new drugs is predicted to face a shortage of patients - BRIC countries may thus play a crucial role in advancing towards a cure for IPF.},

Furthermore, the manuscripts should provide sufficient motivation, examples and applications. This clearly distinguishes Lecture Notes from journal articles or technical reports which normally are very concise. Articles intended for a journal but too long to be accepted by most journals, usually do not have this "lecture notes" character.

abstract = {I n an interesting paper, Scotton et al. (1) reported the ef-fects of IL-13 on the transcriptional profile of human monocytes. Comparing their results with studies analyz-ing the profile induced by IL-4 in murine macrophages (2, 3), the authors notice some differences, giving as examples up-reg-ulation of Ym1 and arginase-1 in murine macrophages, but not in human monocytes. The authors suggest these differences re-flect the fact that IL-4 and IL-13 are highly similar, yet different molecules. Besides overlapping effects with IL-4, IL-13 indeed has documented nonredundant functions and effects (4, 5). However, when comparing results obtained in murine macro-phages to human monocytes, differences between monocytes and differentiated macrophages, as well as interspecies differ-ences, may be involved. Indeed, human monocytes and mono-cyte-derived macrophages exhibit differences in their response to IL-4 and IL-13 (6). Moreover, we and others recently docu-mented that, similar to IL-13, IL-4 does not induce arginase-1 in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (7, 8), in contrast to murine macrophages, where the arginine me-tabolism is even one of the discriminative criteria between so-called alternatively and classically activated macrophages (9). Furthermore, in human monocytes, under conditions inducing mannose receptor and macrophage galactose-type C-type lec-tin, markers for IL-4/IL-13-induced, alternatively activated macrophages (7), we have not detected induction by IL-4 and IL-13 of eosinophil chemotactic cytokine, the closest human homolog of mouse Ym1 by sequence identity (Fig. 1). Overall, next to similarities, murine and human alternatively activated myeloid cells exhibit distinct differences. These should be taken into consideration to make optimal use of information obtained from murine models, and to relate it to the human situation.},

Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data. These transcriptional modules were used as a basis for the selection of biomarkers and the development of a multivariate transcriptional indicator of disease progression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

TCEF3, C/EBP$\alpha$, BACH1, and CREG-1 were among the top transcriptional regulators predicted to regulate these core macrophage- associated genes.

abstract = {We have previously shown that mice that are genetically deficient in the CCR2 gene (CCR2-/- mice) are protected from fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced lung fibrosis. Protection from fibrosis correlated with impaired recruitment of fibrocytes (bone marrow-derived cells, which share both leukocyte and mesenchymal markers). There are three ligands for CCR2 in the mouse: CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12. CCL2 and CCL12 are both elevated in the lung after FITC injury, but with different kinetics. CCL2 is maximal at Day 1 and absent by Day 7 after FITC. In contrast, CCL12 peaks at Day 3, but remains elevated through Day 21 after FITC. We now demonstrate that while CCR2-/- mice are protected from FITC-induced fibrosis, CCL2-/- mice are not. CCL2-/- mice are able to recruit fibrocytes to FITC-injured airspaces, unlike CCR2-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of CCR2-expressing fibrocytes augments FITC-induced fibrosis in both wild-type and CCR2-/- mice, suggesting that these cells play a pathogenic role in the disease process. Both CCL2 and CCL12 are chemotactic for fibrocytes. However, neutralization of CCL12 in wild-type mice significantly protects from FITC-induced fibrosis, whereas neutralization of CCL2 was less effective. Thus, CCL12 is likely the CCR2 ligand responsible for driving fibroproliferation in the mouse. As murine CCL12 is homologous to human CCL2, we suggest that the pathobiology of murine CCL12 in fibroproliferation may correlate to human CCL2 biology.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating lung disease of unknown aetiology. Genetic variations in the IL1RN gene, encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), have been associated with IPF susceptibility. Several studies investigated the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or single nucleotide polymorphisms rs408392, rs419598 and rs2637988, with variable results. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of polymorphisms in IL1RN on IPF susceptibility and mRNA expression. We performed a meta-analysis of the five case-control studies that investigated an IL1RN polymorphism in IPF in a Caucasian population. In addition, we investigated whether IL1RN mRNA expression was influenced by IL1RN polymorphisms. The VNTR, rs408392 and rs419598 were in tight linkage disequilibrium, with D' {\textgreater}0.99. Furthermore, rs2637988 was in linkage disequilibrium with the VNTR (D' = 0.90). A haploblock of VNTR*2 and the minor alleles of rs408392and rs419598 was constructed. Meta-analysis revealed that this VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with IPF susceptibility both with an allelic model (odds ratio = 1.42, p = 0.002) and a carriership model (odds ratio = 1.60, p = 0.002). IL1RN mRNA expression was significantly influenced by rs2637988, with lower levels found in carriers of the (minor) GG genotype (p {\textless}0.001). From this meta-analysis, we conclude that the VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with susceptibility to IPF. In addition, polymorphisms in IL1RN influence IL-1Ra mRNA expression, suggesting that lower levels of IL-1Ra predispose to developing IPF. Together these findings demonstrate that the cytokine IL-1Ra plays a role in IPF pathogenesis.},

abstract = {? 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.Macrophages are dynamic cells that mature under the influence of signals from the local microenvironment into either classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated macrophages with specific functional and phenotypic properties. Although the phenotypic identification of M1 and M2 macrophages is well established in mice, this is less clear for human macrophages. In addition, the persistence and reversibility of polarized human phenotypes is not well established. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into uncommitted macrophages (M0) and then polarized to M1 and M2 phenotypes using LPS/IFN-g and IL-4/IL-13, respectively. M1 and M2 were identified as CD641CD801 and CD11b1CD2091, respectively, by flow cytometry. Polarized M1 cells secreted IP-10, IFN-g, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-1b, and RANTES, whereas M2 cells secreted IL-13, CCL17, and CCL18. Functionally, M2 cells were highly endocytic. In cytokine-deficient medium, the polarized macrophages reverted back to the M0 state within 12 days. If previously polarized macrophages were given the alternative polarizing stimulus after 6 days of resting in cytokine-deficient medium, a switch in polarization was seen (i.e., M1 macrophages switched to M2 and expressed CD11b1CD2091 and vice versa). In summary, we report phenotypic identification of human M1 and M2 macrophages, their functional characteristics, and their ability to be reprogrammed given the appropriate stimuli.},

abstract = {Necroptosis is a recently discovered necrotic cell death which is regulated by receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 under the stimulus of death signal and can be inhibited by necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) specifically. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the role of necroptosis in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) and assess the effect of Nec-1 on lung injury in ARDS. Our results found that RIPK1, RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) were abundantly expressed in rat lung tissues of OA-induced ARDS. Nec-1 pretreatment improved pulmonary function and attenuated lung edema dramatically in OA-induced ARDS rats. Furthermore, Nec-1 reduced RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction and down-regulated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signal pathway, and inhibited inflammatory response by reducing neutrophil infiltration and protein leakage into lung tissue in OA-induced ARDS. Collectively, our study proves the intervention of necroptosis in OA-induced ARDS. Moreover, our findings imply that Nec-1 plays an important role in the treatment of ARDS via inhibiting necroptosis and inflammation.},

Despite the attempts to establish a link between them, the shared biological mechanisms are yet to be characterized. An integrated gene expression meta-analysis of five independent publicly available microarray data of the three diseases was conducted to identify shared gene expression signatures and overlapping biological processes. Using INMEX bioinformatic tool, based on combined Effect Size (ES) approaches, we identified a total of 1,157 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (697 overexpressed and 460 underexpressed genes) shared between the three diseases. EnrichR tool's rich library was used for comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis which revealed “mRNA Splicing” and “SUMO E3 ligases SUMOylate target proteins” among the most enriched terms. Network based meta- analysis identified MYC and FN1 to be the most highly ranked hub genes. Our results reveal that the alterations in biomarkers of the coagulation cascade like F2R, PROS1, SELPLG and ITGB2 were common between the three diseases. Interestingly, the study has generated a novel database of candidate genetic markers, pathways and transcription factors shared between thrombosis and MPDs, which might aid in the development of prognostic therapeutic biomarkers.

abstract = {Pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection of C57BL/6 mice is an established model of a chronic pulmonary fungal infection accompanied by an "allergic" response (T2) to the infection, i.e., a model of an allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Our objective was to determine whether IFN-gamma plays a role in regulating the pulmonary T2 immune response in C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice. Long-term pulmonary fungistasis was lost in IFN-gamma knockout (KO) mice, resulting in an increased pulmonary burden of fungi at wk 3. IFN-gamma was required for the early influx of leukocytes into the lungs but was not required later in the infection. By wk 3, eosinophil and macrophage numbers were elevated in the absence of IFN-gamma. The inducible NO synthase to arginase ratio was lower in the lungs of IFN-gamma KO mice and the macrophages had increased numbers of intracellular cryptococci and YM1 crystals, indicative of alternatively activated macrophages in these mice. There was evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in both wild-type and IFN-gamma KO mice by 5 wk postinfection. IFN-gamma production was not required for the development of T2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) producing cells in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes or induction of an IgE response. At a number of time points, T2 cytokine production was enhanced in IFN-gamma KO mice. Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma, C57BL/6 mice develop an augmented allergic response to C. neoformans, including enhanced generation of alternatively activated macrophages, which is accompanied by a switch from a chronic to a progressive pulmonary cryptococcal infection.},

A major goal of these studies is the identification of important groups of microorganisms that vary according to physiological or disease states in the host, but the incidence of rare taxa and the large numbers of taxa observed make that goal difficult to obtain using traditional approaches. Fortunately, similar problems have been addressed by the machine learning community in other fields of study such as microarray analysis and text classification. In this review, we demonstrate that several existing supervised classifiers can be applied effectively to microbiota classification, both for selecting subsets of taxa that are highly discriminative of the type of community, and for building models that can accurately classify unlabeled data. To encourage the development of new approaches to supervised classification of microbiota, we discuss several structures inherent in microbial community data that may be available for exploitation in novel approaches, and we include as supplemental information several benchmark classification tasks for use by the community.},

abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

Recent studies suggest that the invasion success of many species might depend more heavily on their ability to respond to natural selection than on broad physiological tolerance or plasticity. Thus, these studies stress the importance of genetic architecture, selection upon which could result in evolutionary adaptations and possibly speciation. For instance, epistatic interactions and the action of a few genes could facilitate invasion success. These findings emphasize the utility of genomic approaches for determining invasion mechanisms, through analysis of gene expression, gene interactions, and genomic rearrangements that are associated with invasion events.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {The increasing availability and maturity of DNA microarray technology has led to an explosion of cancer profiling studies. To extract maximum value from the accumulating mass of publicly available cancer gene expression data, methods are needed to evaluate, integrate, and intervalidate multiple datasets. Here we demonstrate a statistical model for performing meta-analysis of independent microarray datasets. Implementation of this model revealed that four prostate cancer gene expression datasets shared significantly similar results, independent of the method and technology used (i.e., spotted cDNA versus oligonucleotide). This interstudy cross-validation approach generated a cohort of genes that were consistently and significantly dysregulated in prostate cancer. Bioinformatic investigation of these genes revealed a synchronous network of transcriptional regulation in the polyamine and purine biosynthesis pathways. Beyond the specific implications for prostate cancer, this work establishes a much-needed model for the evaluation, cross-validation, and comparison of multiple cancer profiling studies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Invasive aspergillosis is a worldwide disease that primarily affects immune-compromised patients, agricultural workers with corneal abrasions, individuals with structural lung disease, and patients with primary immune deficiency. The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets. The strength and efficacy of the host response is shaped by the tissue microenvironment. In preclinical models of disease, host immune augmentation strategies have yielded benefits, yet translating these insights into therapeutic strategies in humans remains challenging. SUMMARY Although advances in early diagnostic strategies and in antifungal drugs have ameliorated clinical outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, further improvements depend on gaining deeper insight into and translating advances in anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {HAMLET (Human Alpha-Lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells), a complex of oleic acid (OA) with partially unfolded human $\alpha$-lactalbumin, shows remarkable toxicity towards a spectrum of tumor cells as well as few differentiated cells including mammalian erythrocytes. Human erythrocytes, for this reason, have been used as convenient model cells to study toxic properties of the OA complexes. The toxicity of HAMLET-like complexes, prepared using immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) isolated from the sera of rabbits immunized with human erythrocytes as well as those unimmunized, towards the red cells was investigated. The OA complex of the IgG prepared by the heat-treatment procedure comprised of protein monomers and oligomers with bound OA. The IgG in the complexes retained most secondary but only partial tertiary structure and complex formation with OA did not abolish the ability of anti-erythrocyte IgG to bind to the erythrocytes. Anti-erythrocyte IgG-OA complexes were remarkably more hemolytic than those prepared using non-specific IgG, while complexes prepared using affinity purified anti-erythrocyte IgG were most effective in hemolyzing the cells. The work suggests that antibodies that exhibit affinity towards target cells may be useful in the preparation of selective and highly toxic OA complexes for the cells.},

abstract = {In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the quantitation of disease severity using pulmonary function tests is often confounded by emphysema. We have identified the composite physiologic index (CPI) most closely reflecting the morphologic extent of pulmonary fibrosis. Consecutive patients with a clinical/computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 212) were divided into group I (n = 106) and group II (n = 106). The CPI was derived in group I (by fitting pulmonary function tests against disease extent on CT) and was tested in Group II. The formula for the CPI was as follows: extent of disease on CT = 91.0 - (0.65 x percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) - (0.53 x percent predicted FVC) + (0.34 x percent predicted FEV1). In group II, the CPI correlated more strongly with disease extent on CT (r2 = 0.51) than the individual pulmonary function test (DLCO the highest value, r2 = 0.38). A subanalysis demonstrated that the better fit of the CPI was ascribable to a correction of the confounding effects of emphysema. Mortality was predicted more accurately by the CPI than by a pulmonary function test in all clinical subgroups, including a separate cohort of 36 patients with histologically proven usual interstitial pneumonia (CPI, p {\textless}0.0005; FVC, p = 0.002; PO2, p = 0.002). In conclusion, a new CPI, derived against CT and validated using split sample testing, is a more accurate prognostic determinant in usual interstitial pneumonia than an individual pulmonary function test.},

abstract = {Literature regarding the differences in gut microbiota between exclusively breastfed (EBF) and non-EBF infants is meager with large variation in methods and results. We performed a meta-analysis of seven studies (a total of 1825 stool samples from 684 infants) to investigate effects of EBF compared to non-EBF on infant gut microbiota across different populations. In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age. These consistent findings across vastly different populations suggest that one of the mechanisms of short and long-term benefits of EBF may be alteration in gut microbes.},

'Big data', 'data science', and 'machine learning' have become familiar terms in the news, as statistical methods are brought to bear upon the enormous data sets of modern science and commerce. How did we get here? And where are we going? This book takes us on an exhilarating journey through the revolution in data analysis following the introduction of electronic computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference. The book ends with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.},

abstract = {The B7 family consists of structurally related, cell-surface protein ligands, which bind to receptors on lymphocytes that regulate immune responses. Activation of T and B lymphocytes is initiated by engagement of cell-surface, antigen-specific T-cell receptors or B-cell receptors, but additional signals delivered simultaneously by B7 ligands determine the ultimate immune response. These 'costimulatory' or 'coinhibitory' signals are delivered by B7 ligands through the CD28 family of receptors on lymphocytes. Interaction of B7-family members with costimulatory receptors augments immune responses, and interaction with coinhibitory receptors attenuates immune responses. There are currently seven known members of the family: B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), inducible costimulator ligand (ICOS-L), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), programmed death-2 ligand (PD-L2), B7-H3, and B7-H4. Members of the family have been characterized predominantly in humans and mice, but some members are also found in birds. They share 20-40{\%} amino-acid identity and are structurally related, with the extracellular domain containing tandem domains related to variable and constant immunoglobulin domains. B7 ligands are expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The importance of the family in regulating immune responses is shown by the development of immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases in mice with mutations in B7-family genes. Manipulation of the signals delivered by B7 ligands has shown potential in the treatment of autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

Using a mice strain carrying a null mutation for the TLR4 receptor, we proved that increased inflammatory parameters after OA challenges were not due to the activation of the TLR4 receptor.

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/{\$}\backslashmu{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}g TSLP and 3.77 pg/{\$}\backslashmu{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}g IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 and 94.3{\%} accuracy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Th e outcomes of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) who undergo hospitalization have not been well characterized. We sought to determine the frequency of all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations and to evaluate their impact on the subsequent course and survival of patients with IPF. METHODS: The records of patients with IPF evaluated at a tertiary center were examined for the cause and duration of hospitalization. Data on subsequent patient outcomes were collated. RESULTS: Th e IPF cohort consisted of 592 patients, 25.3{\%} of whom were hospitalized subse-quent to their IPF diagnosis. A respiratory-related cause accounted for 77.3{\%} of these hospi-talizations. Th e median transplant-free survival for all patients was 23.3 months (interquartile range [IQR], 7.6-63.6 months) from the time of consultation. Transplant-free survival aft er hospital admission was much lower for patients with a respiratory hospitalization com-pared with those with a nonrespiratory hospitalization (median survival, 2.8 months [IQR, 0.63-16.2 months] vs 27.7 months [IQR, 7.4-59.6 months]; P 5 .0004). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that both all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations were strongly asso-ciated with mortality aft er adjusting for baseline demographics. Among patients with a respi-ratory hospitalization, 22.4{\%} died while in the hospital, whereas 16.4{\%} eventually went on to lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations are common events in patients with IPF. Most hospitaliza-tions are respiratory-related and are associated with high in-hospital mortality and limited survival beyond discharge. Both all-cause and respiratory hospitalizations are associated with mortality, and therefore, either could be used as an end point in IPF clinical trials.},

Numerous antifibrotic strategies have been used in the clinic with limited success, raising the possibility that an effective therapeutic strategy in this disease must inhibit fibrosis and promote appropriate lung repair mechanisms. IL-13 represents an attractive target in IPF, but its disease association and mechanism of action remains unknown. In the present study, an overexpression of IL-13 and IL-13 pathway markers was associated with IPF, particularly a rapidly progressive form of this disease. Targeting IL-13 in a humanized experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis using tralokinumab (CAT354) was found to therapeutically block aberrant lung remodeling in this model. However, targeting IL-13 was also found to promote lung repair and to restore epithelial integrity. Thus, targeting IL-13 inhibits fibrotic processes and enhances repair processes in the lung.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is synthesized in the liver and in macrophages, and it has antiatherogenic properties that are mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of plasma cholesterol homeostasis. Previous data suggest that apoE also has antiinflammatory properties that may contribute to protection against atherosclerosis independent of its role in lipid metabolism. In this study, apoE knockout and C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We show that apoE modulates the systemic type I inflammatory response in vivo. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and interferon-gamma were upregulated to a significantly greater extent in apoE-deficient mice than in wild-type mice at both the mRNA and protein levels following administration of LPS. In contrast, hypercholesterolemic low-density lipoprotein receptor/apobec-1 double knockout mice had a similar cytokine response as wild-type mice, eliminating hypercholesterolemia as a cause for the exaggerated cytokine response. Importantly, reconstitution of apoE expression in the liver of apoE-deficient mice normalized the LPS-induced plasma protein levels of IL-12p40. Furthermore, there was selective upregulation of plasma IL-12 in apoE knockout mice by a TLR3 agonist, poly I:C, but not by other TLR agonists, CpG oligonucleotide or Toxoplasma gondii antigen. This implies that apoE selectively regulates TLR4- and TLR3-mediated signaling of IL-12 production. These results indicate that apoE modulates the T helper-1-type immune response in vivo by modulating IL-12 production.},

abstract = {Using a sample from a population to estimate the proportion of the population with a certain category label is a broadly important problem. In the context of microbiome studies, this problem arises when researchers wish to use a sample from a population of microbes to estimate the population proportion of a particular taxon, known as the taxon's relative abundance. In this paper, we propose a beta-binomial model for this task. Like existing models, our model allows for a taxon's relative abundance to be associated with covariates of interest. However, unlike existing models, our proposal also allows for the overdispersion in the taxon's counts to be associated with covariates of interest. We exploit this model in order to propose tests not only for differential relative abundance, but also for differential variability. The latter is particularly valuable in light of speculation that dysbiosis, the perturbation from a normal microbiome that can occur in certain disease conditions, may manifest as a loss of stability, or increase in variability, of the counts associated with each taxon. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed model using a simulation study and an application to soil microbial data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to current therapy and often leads to death. However, the rate of disease progression differs among patients. We hypothesized that comparing the gene expression profiles between patients with stable disease and those in which the disease progressed rapidly will lead to biomarker discovery and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To begin to address this hypothesis, we applied Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate lung expression profiles from diagnostic surgical lung biopsies in 6 individuals with relatively stable (or slowly progressive) IPF and 6 individuals with progressive IPF (based on changes in DLCO and FVC over 12 months). Our results indicate that this comprehensive lung IPF SAGE transcriptome is distinct from normal lung tissue and other chronic lung diseases. To identify candidate markers of disease progression, we compared the IPF SAGE profiles in stable and progressive disease, and identified a set of 102 transcripts that were at least 5-fold up regulated and a set of 89 transcripts that were at least 5-fold down regulated in the progressive group (P-value{\textless}/=0.05). The over expressed genes included surfactant protein A1, two members of the MAPK-EGR-1-HSP70 pathway that regulate cigarette-smoke induced inflammation, and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated), a gene not previously implicated in IPF. Interestingly, 26 of the up regulated genes are also increased in lung adenocarcinomas and have low or no expression in normal lung tissue. More importantly, we defined a SAGE molecular expression signature of 134 transcripts that sufficiently distinguished relatively stable from progressive IPF. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of diagnosis could prove helpful in predicting the likelihood of disease progression or possibly understanding the biological activity of IPF.},

The new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated, and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are undefined.

abstract = {Macrophages are endowed with a variety of receptors for lineage-determining growth factors, T helper (Th) cell cytokines, and B cell, host, and microbial products. In tissues, macrophages mature and are activated in a dynamic response to combinations of these stimuli to acquire specialized functional phenotypes. As for the lymphocyte system, a dichotomy has been proposed for macrophage activation: classic vs. alternative, also M1 and M2, respectively. In view of recent research about macrophage functions and the increasing number of immune-relevant ligands, a revision of the model is needed. Here, we assess how cytokines and pathogen signals influence their functional phenotypes and the evidence for M1 and M2 functions and revisit a paradigm initially based on the role of a restricted set of selected ligands in the immune response.},

In North America, many unsuspected cases are discovered by laboratory testing. The etiological agent, Treponema pallidum, cannot be cultured, and there is no single optimal alternative test. Serological testing is the most frequently used approach in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. The present paper discusses the various serological and alternative tests currently available along with their limitations, and relates their results to the likely corresponding clinical stage of the disease. The need to use multiple tests is discussed, and the importance of quality control is noted. The complexity of syphilis serology means that the services of reference laboratories and clinical experts are often needed.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease defined by the presence of nonnecrotizing granuloma in the absence of any known cause. Although clinically, the heterogeneity of sarcoidosis is well characterized, the transcriptome of the sarcoidosis and underlying molecular mechanisms are not. The signal of all transcripts, small and long noncoding RNAs, can be detected using microarrays or RNA-Sequencing. Analyzing the transcriptome of tissues that are directly affected by granulomas is of great importance to understand biology of the disease and may be predictive of disease and treatment outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Multiple genome wide expression studies performed on sarcoidosis affected tissues were published in the last 11 years. Published studies focused to examine differences in gene expression levels between sarcoidosis vs. control tissues, stable vs. progressive form of sarcoidosis, as well as sarcoidosis vs. other diseases. Strikingly, all these transcriptomics data confirm the key role of TH1 immune response in sarcoidosis and particularly of interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) and type I IFN-driven signaling pathways. SUMMARY First steps toward transcriptomics of sarcoidosis in precision medicine are taken and highlight the potentials of this approach. Large prospective follow-up studies are required to identify signatures predictive of disease progression and outcome.},

abstract = {Objective Weight loss surgery results in significant changes in the anatomy, function, and intraluminal environment of the gastrointestinal tract affecting the gut microbiome. Although bariatric surgery results in sustained weight loss, decreased appetite, and hedonic eating, it is unknown whether the surgery-induced alterations in gut microbiota play a role in the observed changes in hedonic eating. We explored the following hypotheses: (1) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) results in changes in gut microbial composition; (2) alterations in gut microbiota are related to weight loss; (3) alterations in gut microbiome are associated with changes in appetite and hedonic eating. Methods Eight obese women underwent LSG. Their body mass index, body fat mass, food intake, hunger, hedonic eating scores, and stool samples were obtained at baseline and 1-month postsurgery. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on stool samples. DESeq2 changes in microbial abundance. Multilevel-sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis was applied to genus-level abundance for discriminative microbial signatures. Results LSG resulted in significant reductions in body mass index, food intake, and hedonic eating. A microbial signature composed of five bacterial genera discriminated between pre- and postsurgery status. Several bacterial genera were significantly associated with weight loss (Bilophila, q = 3E-05; Faecalibacterium q = 4E-05), lower appetite (Enterococcus, q = 3E-05), and reduced hedonic eating (Akkermansia, q =.037) after surgery. Conclusions In this preliminary analysis, changes in gut microbial abundance discriminated between pre- and postoperative status. Alterations in gut microbiome were significantly associated with weight loss and with reduced hedonic eating after surgery; however, a larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.},

Although -CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes (CCR2⁺Mo) and their derivatives initiate adaptive pulmonary immune responses, their role in coordinating innate immune responses in the lung remain poorly defined. Using conditional and antibody-mediated cell ablation strategies, we found that CCR2⁺Mo and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) are essential for innate defense against inhaled conidia. By harnessing fluorescent Aspergillus reporter (FLARE) conidia that report fungal cell association and viability in vivo, we identify two mechanisms by which CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs exert innate antifungal activity. First, CCR2⁺Mo and Mo-DCs condition the lung inflammatory milieu to augment neutrophil conidiacidal activity. Second, conidial uptake by CCR2⁺Mo temporally coincided with their differentiation into Mo-DCs, a process that resulted in direct conidial killing. Our findings illustrate both indirect and direct functions for CCR2⁺Mo and their derivatives in innate antifungal immunity in the lung.},

Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or differentiated in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic polarization conditions. Computational analysis relates a spectrum of cellular states in vivo to in-vitro-differentiated Th17 cells and unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four new genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso, and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while potentially sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.},

abstract = {Fibrogenesis involves a pathological accumulation of activated fibroblasts and extensive matrix remodeling. Profibrotic cytokines, such as TGF-{\$}\beta{\$}, stimulate fibroblasts to overexpress fibrotic matrix proteins and induce further expression of profibrotic cytokines, resulting in progressive fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a profibrotic cytokine that is indicative of fibroblast activation. Epithelial cells are abundant in the normal lung, but their contribution to fibrogenesis remains poorly defined. Profibrotic cytokines may activate epithelial cells with protein expression and functions that overlap with the functions of active fibroblasts. We found that alveolar epithelial cells undergoing TGF-{\$}\beta{\$}-mediated mesenchymal transition in vitro were also capable of activating lung fibroblasts through production of CTGF. Alveolar epithelial cell expression of CTGF was dramatically reduced by inhibition of Rho signaling. CTGF reporter mice demonstrated increased CTGF promoter activity by lung epithelial cells acutely after bleomycin in vivo. Furthermore, mice with lung epithelial cell-specific deletion of CTGF had an attenuated fibrotic response to bleomycin. These studies provide direct evidence that epithelial cell activation initiates a cycle of fibrogenic effector cell activation during progressive fibrosis. Therapy targeted at epithelial cell production of CTGF offers a novel pathway for abrogating this progressive cycle and limiting tissue fibrosis.},

Potential intervention strategies that aim to manipulate these cells will require an in-depth understanding of their origins and the mechanisms that ensure their homeostasis. Recent evidence shows that monocytes do not substantially contribute to most tissue macrophage populations in the steady state or during certain types of inflammation. Rather, most tissue macrophage populations in mice are derived from embryonic precursors, are seeded before birth and can maintain themselves in adults by self-renewal. In this Review, we discuss the evidence that has dramatically changed our understanding of monocyte and macrophage development, and the maintenance of these cells in the steady state.},

abstract = {Many diseases accompanied by chronic inflammation are connected with dysregulated activation of macrophage subpopulations. Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO2-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1–5 min) experiments. We discovered that NO2-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO2-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO2-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO2-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO2-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO2-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease, which involves dysfunctions in multi-omics. The changes in biological processes, such as adhesion junction, signaling transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation, will lead to the occurrence of COPD. A novel systematic approach MMMG (Methylation-MicroRNA-MRNA-GO) was proposed to identify potential COPD genes by integrating function information with a methylation profile, a microRNA expression profile and an mRNA expression profile. 8 co-functional classes and 102 potential COPD genes were identified. These genes displayed a high performance in classifying COPD patients and normal samples, revealed COPD-related pathways, and have been confirmed to be associated with COPD by Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)-values, literature, an independent data set, and pathways. The MMMG method that analyzed multi-omics data at the functional level could effectively identify potential COPD genes. These potential COPD genes would provide in-depth insights into understanding the complexity of COPD genome landscapes, improve the early diagnostics, and guide new efforts to develop therapeutics in the future.},

abstract = {Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by an early inflammatory response followed by a late fibroproliferative phase, and by an increase in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) concentrations of bioactive soluble FasL (sFasL). Activation of Fas (CD95) has been associated with the development of lung fibrosis in mice. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms that link Fas activation with the development of fibrosis in the lungs. We treated mice with three daily intratracheal instillations of a Fas-activating monoclonal antibody (Jo2) or a control IgG, and studied the animals at sequential times. Mice treated with Jo2 had increased caspase-3 activation in alveolar wall cells on Days 2, 4, and 7; an inflammatory response peaking on Day 7, and increased total lung collagen on Day 21. Gene expression profiling performed on Days 2, 4, and 7 showed sequential activation of co-regulated profibrotic genes, including marked up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12). Targeted deletion of MMP-12 protected mice from Fas-induced pulmonary fibrosis, even though the inflammatory responses in the lungs were similar to those of wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, the mmp12(-/-) mice showed decreased expression of the profibrotic genes egr1 and cyr61. We conclude that Fas activation in the lungs induces a complex response that includes apoptosis, inflammation, and eventually fibrosis, and that MMP-12 is essential for the fibrotic phenotype. We speculate that MMP-12 activity is required for activation of the profibrotic genes egr1 and cyr61.},

abstract = {Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF5 that lead to higher mRNA expression are associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IRF5 expression in macrophages was reversibly induced by inflammatory stimuli and contributed to the plasticity of macrophage polarization. High expression of IRF5 was characteristic of M1 macrophages, in which it directly activated transcription of the genes encoding interleukin 12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40), IL-12p35 and IL-23p19 and repressed the gene encoding IL-10. Consequently, those macrophages set up the environment for a potent T helper type 1 (T(H)1)-T(H)17 response. Global gene expression analysis demonstrated that exogenous IRF5 upregulated or downregulated expression of established phenotypic markers of M1 or M2 macrophages, respectively. Our data suggest a critical role for IRF5 in M1 macrophage polarization and define a previously unknown function for IRF5 as a transcriptional repressor.},

abstract = {The initial stimulus for inflammatory cell recruitment and the mechanisms responsible for the perpetuation and evolution of chronic inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. Although interleukin (IL)-13, a Th2 cytokine, has been shown to have direct effects on fibroblasts that support fibroproliferation, it is also a potent inducer of a novel CC chemokine, C10, which is chemotactic for mononuclear phagocytes. The macrophage/mononuclear phagocyte has been shown to have a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, serving as an important source of growth factors that regulate extracellular matrix synthesis. In this study we demonstrate that IL-13 and C10 are elevated in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Neutralization of IL-13, but not IL-4, attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and levels of C10, suggesting that IL-13 has an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. IL-13 is a potent inducer of C10 in vivo, and neutralization of C10 attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and intrapulmonary macrophage numbers. This suggests that IL-13 has a role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis that is independent of its direct effect on fibroblasts and is evidence for an interaction between Th2 cytokines and specific CC chemokines.},

Our study examined the hypothesis that there were distinct differences in protein expression profiles that were related to the phenotype. From among the 323+/-51 protein spots that may represent the most highly expressed proteins in BALf of these patients, 24 unique spots were isolated and proteins identified. In particular, 9 spots were present in BALf of PM/DM patients only; 12 spots were exclusive of Overlap patients and 3 spots of AS patients. From among the proteins identified, a few were classified as cytoskeletal proteins, others were involved in oxidative stress and a number of proteins were associated with general metabolic activity or immunological response and inflammation. This is the first study in which evidence is provided that a number of different proteins are expressed in different subsets of PM/DM and supports our contention that the proteomic approach would be beneficial in discovering molecules which could represent possible prognostic factors of these rare pathologies.},

We now demonstrate a major role for CD8+ T cells in a murine model of sterile lung injury. These pulmonary CD8+ T cells differentiate into IL-13-producing Tc2 cells and play a major role in a bleomycin-induced model of fibrosis. Differentiation of these Tc2 cells in the lung requires IL-21, and bleomycin treated IL-21-and IL-21R-deficient mice develop inflammation but not fibrosis. Moreover, IL-21R-expressing CD8+ cells are sufficient to reconstitute the fibrotic response in IL-21R-deficient mice. We further show that the combination of IL-4 and IL-21 skews naive CD8+ T cells to produce IL-21, which, in turn, acts in an autocrine manner to support robust IL-13 production. Our data reveal a novel pathway involved in the onset and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis and identify Tc2 cells as key mediators of fibrogenesis.},

abstract = {Gene set enrichment (GSE) analyses play an important role in the interpretation of large-scale transcriptome datasets. Multiple GSE tools can be integrated into a single method as obtaining optimal results is challenging due to the plethora of GSE tools and their discrepant performances. Several existing ensemble methods lead to different scores in sorting pathways as integrated results; furthermore, it is difficult for users to choose a single ensemble score to obtain optimal final results. Here, we develop an ensemble method using a machine learning approach called Combined Gene set analysis incorporating Prioritization and Sensitivity (CGPS) that integrates the results provided by nine prominent GSE tools into a single ensemble score (R score) to sort pathways as integrated results. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, CGPS is the first GSE ensemble method built based on a priori knowledge of pathways and phenotypes. Compared with 10 widely used individual methods and five types of ensemble scores from two ensemble methods, we demonstrate that sorting pathways based on the R score can better prioritize relevant pathways, as established by an evaluation of 120 simulated datasets and 45 real datasets. Additionally, CGPS is applied to expression data involving the drug panobinostat, which is an anticancer treatment against multiple myeloma. The results identify cell processes associated with cancer, such as the p53 signaling pathway (hsa04115); by contrast, according to two ensemble methods (EnrichmentBrowser and EGSEA), this pathway has a rank higher than 20, which may cause users to miss the pathway in their analyses. We show that this method, which is based on a priori knowledge, can capture valuable biological information from numerous types of gene set collections, such as KEGG pathways, GO terms, Reactome, and BioCarta. CGPS is publicly available as a standalone source code at ftp://ftp.cbi.pku.edu.cn/pub/CGPS{\_}download/cgps-1.0.0.tar.gz.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abundant collagen production and accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) in the lower respiratory tract. Mechanisms as to how alveolar macrophages are activated by collagen breakdown products are unknown. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 37 healthy donors (HD). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in the presence of collagen type I, III, IV and V monomers w/wo a neutralizing antibody against scavenger receptor I class A (CD204). Culture supernatants were assayed for the M2 markers CCL18, CCL2, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) by ELISA. Furthermore, expression of phospho-Akt was measured using ELISA and expression of CD204 by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stimulation with collagen type I and III monomers significantly up-regulated CCL18, IL-1ra production of alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CD204 were up-regulated by collagen type I exposure. In addition, collagen type I stimulation increased pospho-Akt expression. Collagen type I effects were abrogated by neutralizing antiCD204 and a non-selective Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Spontaneous CD204 expression of alveolar macrophages was significantly increased in patients with IPF. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that monomeric collagen type I via CD204 induces phospho-Akt expression shifting alveolar macrophages to the profibrotic M2 type. Innate immune responses induced by collagen monomers might perpetuate pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling technology has resulted in detailed transcriptome data for a wide range of tissues, conditions and diseases. In neuroscience, expression datasets were mostly generated using whole brain tissue samples, resulting in data from a mixture of cell types, including glial cells and neurons. Over the past few years, a rapidly increasing number of expression profiling studies using isolated microglial cell populations have been reported. In these studies, the microglia transcriptome was compared to other cell types, such as other brain cells and peripheral tissue macrophages, and related to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. A commonality found in many of these studies was that microglia possess distinct gene expression signatures. This repertoire of selectively-expressed microglial genes highlight functions beyond immune responses, such as synaptic modulation and neurotrophic support, and open up avenues to explore as-yet-unexpected roles. These data provide improved understanding of disease pathology, and complement not only the aforementioned whole brain tissue transcriptome studies, but also genome- and epigenome-wide association studies. In this review, insights obtained from isolated microglia transcriptome studies are presented, and compared to studies using other genome-wide approaches. The relation of microglia to other tissue macrophages and glial cell populations, as well as the role of microglia in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative conditions, will be discussed. Many more of these types of studies are expected in the near future, hopefully leading to the identification of novel genes and targets for neurodegenerative conditions. GLIA 2015.},

Here, we propose to review and to present a concise discuss on the role of different components during tissue repair, including those related to innate immune receptors and metabolic modifications. The scar formation is directly related to the degree of inflammation, but also with the appearance of M2 macrophages. In spite of greater numbers of macrophages in the fibrotic phase, regulatory macrophages present some characteristics related to promotion of fibrosis but also with the control of scar formation. These regulatory macrophages present an oxidative metabolism, and differ from the initial inflammatory macrophages, which in turn, present a glycolytic characteristic, which allow regulatory ones to optimize the oxygen consumption and minimizing their ROS production. We will emphasize the difference in macrophage subpopulations and the origin and plasticity of these cells during fibrotic processes.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {T helper 1 responses are typically proinflammatory, while Th2 responses have been considered regulatory. Interestingly, Th2 responses characterize a number of pulmonary diseases, many of which terminate in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. We developed a mouse model using Schistosoma mansoni eggs and cytokine-deficient mice to induce highly polarized Th1- or Th2-type inflammation in the lung. In this study, we examined the pathology and cytokine profiles in Th1- and Th2-polarized environments and used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to decipher the genes responsible for these effects. We further elaborated on the results using IL-10- and IL-13-deficient mice because these cytokines are believed to be the central regulators of Th2-associated pathology. We found that the Th1-polarized mice developed small granulomas with less fibrosis while expressing genes characteristic of tissue damage. Th2-polarized mice, in contrast, formed large granulomas with massive collagen deposition and up-regulated genes associated-with wound healing, specifically, arginase, collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMP. In addition, several members of the chitinase-like family were up-regulated in the lung following egg challenge. We also developed a method of defining the net collagen deposition using the expression profiles of several collagen, MMP, and tissue inhibitors of MMP genes. We found that Th1-polarized mice did not elaborate collagens or MMPs and therefore did not have a significant capacity for repair in this model. Thus, Th1-mediated inflammation is characterized by tissue damage, while Th2 directs wound healing and fibrosis.},

abstract = {We study the application of a widely used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM), for continuous outcomes. Such models are attractive for the analysis of continuous response variables because they are invariant to any monotonic transformation of the outcome and because they directly model the cumulative distribution function from which summaries such as expectations and quantiles can easily be derived. Such models can also readily handle mixed type distributions. We describe the motivation, estimation, inference, model assumptions, and diagnostics. We demonstrate that CPMs applied to continuous outcomes are semiparametric transformation models. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the finite sample performance of these models. We find that properly specified CPMs generally have good finite sample performance with moderate sample sizes, but that bias may occur when the sample size is small. Cumulative probability models are fairly robust to minor or moderate link function misspecification in our simulations. For certain purposes, the CPMs are more efficient than other models. We illustrate their application, with model diagnostics, in a study of the treatment of HIV. CD4 cell count and viral load 6 months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy are modeled using CPMs; both variables typically require transformations, and viral load has a large proportion of measurements below a detection limit.},

Its epidemiology has been difficult to study because of its rarity and evolution in diagnostic and coding practices. Though uncommon, it is likely underappreciated both in terms of its occurrence (ie, incidence, prevalence) and public health impact (ie, health care costs and resource utilization). Incidence and mortality appear to be on the rise, and prevalence is expected to increase with the aging population. Potential risk factors include occupational and environmental exposures, tobacco smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, and genetic factors. An accurate understanding of its epidemiology is important, especially as novel therapies are emerging.},

Intravascular functions of " classical " Ly6C + monocytes and their interactions with other lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes in the circulation remain poorly understood. Rather, these cells are known to efficiently extravasate into tissues. Indeed, Ly6C + monocytes and their descendants have emerged as a third, highly plastic and dynamic cellular system that complements the two classical, tissue-resident mononuclear phagocyte compartments, i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells, on demand. Following recruitment to injured tissue, Ly6C + monocytes respond to local cues and can critically contribute to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory reactions. The second main murine monocyte subset, Ly6C – cells, derive in steady state from Ly6C + monocytes and remain in the vasculature, where the cells act as scavengers. Moreover, a major fraction of Ly6C – monocytes adheres to the capillary endothelium and patrols the vessel wall for surveillance. Given the central role of monocytes in homeostasis and pathology, in-depth study of this cellular compartment can be highly informative on the health state of the organism and provides an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abundant collagen production and accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) in the lower respiratory tract. Mechanisms as to how alveolar macrophages are activated by collagen breakdown products are unknown. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 37 healthy donors (HD). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in the presence of collagen type I, III, IV and V monomers w/wo a neutralizing antibody against scavenger receptor I class A (CD204). Culture supernatants were assayed for the M2 markers CCL18, CCL2, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) by ELISA. Furthermore, expression of phospho-Akt was measured using ELISA and expression of CD204 by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stimulation with collagen type I and III monomers significantly up-regulated CCL18, IL-1ra production of alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CD204 were up-regulated by collagen type I exposure. In addition, collagen type I stimulation increased pospho-Akt expression. Collagen type I effects were abrogated by neutralizing antiCD204 and a non-selective Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Spontaneous CD204 expression of alveolar macrophages was significantly increased in patients with IPF. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that monomeric collagen type I via CD204 induces phospho-Akt expression shifting alveolar macrophages to the profibrotic M2 type. Innate immune responses induced by collagen monomers might perpetuate pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Background The mechanism of TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2/TH17-low asthma is unknown. Objective We sought to study the immune mechanism of TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2/TH17-low asthma. Methods In a previously reported cohort of 60 asthmatic patients, 16 patients were immunophenotyped with TH2/TH17-predominant asthma and 22 patients with TH2/TH17-low asthma. We examined bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid leukocytes, cytokines, mediators, and epithelial cell function for these asthma subgroups. Results Patients with TH2/TH17-predominant asthma had increased IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-23, C3a, and serum amyloid A levels in BAL fluid, and these correlated with IL-1$\beta$ and C3a levels. TH2/TH17 cells expressed higher levels of the IL-1 receptor and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, inhibited BAL TH2/TH17 cell counts. TH2/TH17-low asthma had 2 distinct subgroups: neutrophilic asthma (45{\%}) and pauci-inflammatory asthma (55{\%}). This contrasted with patients with TH2/TH17-predominant and TH2-predominant asthma, which included neutrophilic asthma in 6{\%} and 0{\%} of patients, respectively. BAL fluid neutrophils strongly correlated with BAL fluid myeloperoxidase, IL-8, IL-1$\alpha$, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. Sixty percent of the patients with neutrophilic asthma had a pathogenic microorganism in BAL culture, which suggested a subclinical infection. Conclusion We uncovered a critical role for the IL-1$\beta$ pathway in patients with TH2/TH17-predminant asthma. A subgroup of patients with TH2/TH17-low asthma had neutrophilic asthma and increased BAL fluid IL-1$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. IL-1$\alpha$ was directly involved in IL-8 production and likely contributed to neutrophilic asthma. Sixty percent of neutrophilic patients had a subclinical infection.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients. In the immunocompetent host, inhaled conidia are cleared by alveolar macrophages. The signaling pathways of the alveolar macrophage involved in the clearance of A. fumigatus are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of TLRs in the immune response against A. fumigatus and their contribution to the signaling events triggered in murine alveolar macrophages upon infection with A. fumigatus conidia. Specifically, we examined the MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation and cytokine signaling. Our investigations revealed that immunocompetent TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were not more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis as compared with wild-type mice and that the in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK and p38 was not affected in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 knockout mice following stimulation with conidia. In vivo experiments suggest that ERK was an essential MAPK in the defense against A. fumigatus, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB appeared to play only a secondary role. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLR2/4 recognition and MyD88 signaling are dispensable for the clearance of A. fumigatus under immunocompetent situations. Furthermore, our data stress the important role of ERK activation in innate immunity to A. fumigatus.},

abstract = {Human in vitro generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages are used clinically, e.g., to induce immunity against cancer. However, their physiological counterparts, ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and heterogeneity remains largely unknown, hampering their clinical use. High-dimensional techniques were used to elucidate transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional differences between human in vivo and in vitro generated mononuclear phagocytes to facilitate their full potential in the clinic. We demonstrate that monocytes differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resembled in vivo inflammatory macrophages, while moDCs resembled in vivo inflammatory DCs. Moreover, differentiated monocytes presented with profound transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional differences. Monocytes integrated GM-CSF and IL-4 stimulation combinatorically and temporally, resulting in a mode- and time-dependent differentiation relying on NCOR2. Finally, moDCs are phenotypically heterogeneous and therefore necessitate the use of high-dimensional phenotyping to open new possibilities for better clinical tailoring of these cellular therapies.},

abstract = {Genomic variation underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) likely involves the interaction and regulation of multiple genes in a network. Data-driven co-expression network module inference has the potential to account for variation within regulatory networks, reduce the dimensionality of RNA-Seq data, and detect significant gene-expression modules associated with depression severity. We performed an RNA-Seq gene co-expression network analysis of mRNA data obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of unmedicated MDD (n = 78) and healthy control (n = 79) subjects. Across the combined MDD and HC groups, we assigned genes into modules using hierarchical clustering with a dynamic tree cut method and projected the expression data onto a lower-dimensional module space by computing the single-sample gene set enrichment score of each module. We tested the single-sample scores of each module for association with levels of depression severity measured by the Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression Scale (MADRS). Independent of MDD status, we identified 23 gene modules from the co-expression network. Two modules were significantly associated with the MADRS score after multiple comparison adjustment (adjusted p = 0.009, 0.028 at 0.05 FDR threshold), and one of these modules replicated in a previous RNA-Seq study of MDD (p = 0.03). The two MADRS-associated modules contain genes previously implicated in mood disorders and show enrichment of apoptosis and B cell receptor signaling. The genes in these modules show a correlation between network centrality and univariate association with depression, suggesting that intramodular hub genes are more likely to be related to MDD compared to other genes in a module.},

abstract = {Inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages are key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. After tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically.},

abstract = {The bleomycin-induced rodent lung fibrosis model is commonly used to study mechanisms of lung fibrosis and to test potential therapeutic interventions, despite the well recognized dissimilarities to human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify genomic commonalities between the gene expression profiles from 100 IPF lungs and 108 control lungs that were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, and rat lungs harvested at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 after bleomycin instillation. Surprisingly, the highest gene expression similarity between bleomycin-treated rat and IPF lungs was observed at Day 7. At this point of maximal rat-human commonality, we identified a novel set of 12 disease-relevant translational gene markers (C6, CTHRC1, CTSE, FHL2, GAL, GREM1, LCN2, MMP7, NELL1, PCSK1, PLA2G2A, and SLC2A5) that was able to separate almost all patients with IPF from control subjects in our cohort and in two additional IPF/control cohorts (GSE10667 and GSE24206). Furthermore, in combination with diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide measurements, four members of the translational gene marker set contributed to stratify patients with IPF according to disease severity. Significantly, pirfenidone attenuated the expression change of one (CTHRC1) translational gene marker in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, in transforming growth factor-$\beta$1-treated primary human lung fibroblasts and transforming growth factor-$\beta$1-treated human epithelial A549 cells. Our results suggest that a strategy focused on rodent model-human disease commonalities may identify genes that could be used to predict the pharmacological impact of therapeutic interventions, and thus facilitate the development of novel treatments for this devastating lung disease.},

abstract = {TO THE EDITOR: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown etiology that primarily affects the elderly and for which usual interstitial pneumonia is the substrate. (1) Patients with IPF usually experience progressive loss of pulmonary function and severely impaired quality of life, evolving to death. The treatment of IPF has always been a challenge. However, in late 2014, the US Food and Drug Admi-nistration approved two new drugs for the treatment of patients with this disease. Now it is clear that both drugs reduce the rate of decline in pulmonary function in individuals affected by the disease. In addition, clinical trials are underway to investigate new drugs with different mechanisms of action. We are seeing the beginning of a new era in the care of IPF patients, which is promising but also implies additional needs and concerns. In particular, health--related governmental decisions should be based on robust epidemiological data, and, unfortunately, there are few such data on IPF in Brazil. One important and still unresolved issue concerns the true incidence and prevalence of IPF and, consequently, the total number of affected patients in Brazil. When we analyzed the international literature, we found that characterizing the epidemiology of IPF is not a problem solely in Brazil. Some of the difficulties stem from the fact that the current definition of the disease came into use from 2000 onward. In addition, results vary depending on the criteria used by different authors to define a case of IPF. Nevertheless, there is a consensus that the disease affects more men than women, that it is more common after the fifth decade of life, and that its incidence has been increasing over the years, as has the associated mortality.

abstract = {The lung is exposed to a vast array of inhaled antigens, particulate matter, and pollution. Cells present in the airways must therefore be maintained in a generally suppressive phenotype so that excessive responses to nonserious irritants do not occur; these result in bystander damage to lung architecture, influx of immune cells to the airways, and consequent impairment of gas exchange. To this end, the resident cells of the lung, which are predominantly macrophages, are kept in a dampened state. However, on occasion the suppression fails and these macrophages overreact to antigenic challenge, resulting in release of inflammatory mediators, induction of death of lung epithelial cells, deposition of extracellular matrix, and development of immunopathology. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms behind this macrophage-mediated pathology, in the context of a number of inflammatory pulmonary disorders.},

The critical function of the immune system is to prevent the germination of airborne conidia into tissue-invasive hyphae. This review covers recent advances that shape our understanding of anti-Aspergillus immunity at the molecular and cellular level. RECENT FINDINGS Host defense against conidia and hyphae occurs via distinct molecular mechanisms that involve intracellular and extracellular killing pathways, as well as cooperation between different myeloid cell subsets. The strength and efficacy of the host response is shaped by the tissue microenvironment. In preclinical models of disease, host immune augmentation strategies have yielded benefits, yet translating these insights into therapeutic strategies in humans remains challenging. SUMMARY Although advances in early diagnostic strategies and in antifungal drugs have ameliorated clinical outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, further improvements depend on gaining deeper insight into and translating advances in anti-Aspergillus immunity.},

We use median rank scores and quantile discretization to derive numerically comparable measures of gene expression from different platforms. These transformed data are then used for training of classifiers based on support vector machines. We apply this approach to six publicly available cancer microarray gene expression data sets, which consist of three pairs of studies, each examining the same type of cancer, i.e. breast cancer, prostate cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. For each pair, one study was performed by means of cDNA microarrays and the other by means of oligonucleotide microarrays. In each pair, high classification accuracies ({\textgreater} 85{\%}) were achieved with training and testing on data instances randomly chosen from both data sets in a cross-validation analysis. To exemplify the potential of this cross-platform classification analysis, we use two leukemia microarray data sets to show that important genes with regard to the biology of leukemia are selected in an integrated analysis, which are missed in either single-set analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Cross-platform classification of multiple cancer microarray data sets yields discriminative gene expression signatures that are found and validated on a large number of microarray samples, generated by different laboratories and microarray technologies. Predictive models generated by this approach are better validated than those generated on a single data set, while showing high predictive power and improved generalization performance.},

abstract = {A novel, MS-based approach for the relative quantification of proteins, relying on the derivatization of primary amino groups in intact proteins using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is presented. Due to the isobaric mass design of the iTRAQ reagents, differentially labeled proteins do not differ in mass; accordingly, their corresponding proteolytic peptides appear as single peaks in MS scans. Because quantitative information is provided by isotope-encoded reporter ions that can only be observed in MS/MS spectra, we analyzed the fragmentation behavior of ESI and MALDI ions of peptides generated from iTRAQ-labeled proteins using a TOF/TOF and/or a QTOF instrument. We observed efficient liberation of reporter ions for singly protonated peptides at low-energy collision conditions. In contrast, increased collision energies were required to liberate the iTRAQ label from lysine side chains of doubly charged peptides and, thus, to observe reporter ions suitable for relative quantification of proteins with high accuracy. We then developed a quantitative strategy that comprises labeling of intact proteins by iTRAQ followed by gel electrophoresis and peptide MS/MS analyses. As proof of principle, mixtures of five different proteins in various concentration ratios were quantified, demonstrating the general applicability of the approach presented here to quantitative MS-based proteomics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Determine the coverage rate of syphilis testing during prenatal care and the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil. METHODS: This is a national hospital-based cohort study conducted in Brazil with 23,894 postpartum women between 2011 and 2012. Data were obtained using interviews with postpartum women, hospital records, and prenatal care cards. All postpartum women with a reactive serological test result recorded in the prenatal care card or syphilis diagnosis during hospitalization for childbirth were considered cases of syphilis in pregnancy. The Chi-square test was used for determining the disease prevalence and testing coverage rate by region of residence, self-reported skin color, maternal age, and type of prenatal and child delivery care units. RESULTS: Prenatal care covered 98.7{\%} postpartum women. Syphilis testing coverage rate was 89.1{\%} (one test) and 41.2{\%} (two tests), and syphilis prevalence in pregnancy was 1.02{\%} (95{\%}CI 0.84;1.25). A lower prenatal coverage rate was observed among women in the North region, indigenous women, those with less education, and those who received prenatal care in public health care units. A lower testing coverage rate was observed among residents in the North, Northeast, and Midwest regions, among younger and non-white skin-color women, among those with lower education, and those who received prenatal care in public health care units. An increased prevalence of syphilis was observed among women with {\textless}8 years of education (1.74{\%}), who self-reported as black (1.8{\%}) or mixed (1.2{\%}), those who did not receive prenatal care (2.5{\%}), and those attending public (1.37{\%}) or mixed (0.93{\%}) health care units.},

We now demonstrate a major role for CD8+ T cells in a murine model of sterile lung injury. These pulmonary CD8+ T cells differentiate into IL-13-producing Tc2 cells and play a major role in a bleomycin-induced model of fibrosis. Differentiation of these Tc2 cells in the lung requires IL-21, and bleomycin treated IL-21-and IL-21R-deficient mice develop inflammation but not fibrosis. Moreover, IL-21R-expressing CD8+ cells are sufficient to reconstitute the fibrotic response in IL-21R-deficient mice. We further show that the combination of IL-4 and IL-21 skews naive CD8+ T cells to produce IL-21, which, in turn, acts in an autocrine manner to support robust IL-13 production. Our data reveal a novel pathway involved in the onset and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis and identify Tc2 cells as key mediators of fibrogenesis.},

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in injury and recovery in ischemic injury. They are proteolytic enzymes that degrade all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). They are secreted in a latent form, protecting the cell from damage, but once activated induce injury prior to rapid inactivation by four tissue inhibitors to metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Normally the constitutive enzymes, MMP-2 and membrane type MMP (MMP-14), are activated in a spatially specific manner and act close to the site of activation, while the inducible enzymes, MMP-3 and MMP-9, become active through the action of free radicals and other enzymes during neuroinflammation. Because of the complex nature of the interactions with tissues during development, injury and repair, the MMPs have multiple roles, participating in the injury process in the early stages and contributing to recovery during the later stages. This dual role complicates the planning of treatment strategies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Cell Interactions In Stroke.},

abstract = {Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF5 that lead to higher mRNA expression are associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IRF5 expression in macrophages was reversibly induced by inflammatory stimuli and contributed to the plasticity of macrophage polarization. High expression of IRF5 was characteristic of M1 macrophages, in which it directly activated transcription of the genes encoding interleukin 12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40), IL-12p35 and IL-23p19 and repressed the gene encoding IL-10. Consequently, those macrophages set up the environment for a potent T helper type 1 (T(H)1)-T(H)17 response. Global gene expression analysis demonstrated that exogenous IRF5 upregulated or downregulated expression of established phenotypic markers of M1 or M2 macrophages, respectively. Our data suggest a critical role for IRF5 in M1 macrophage polarization and define a previously unknown function for IRF5 as a transcriptional repressor.},

abstract = {| Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by progressive lung scarring and the histological picture of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). It is associated with increasing cough and dyspnoea and impaired quality of life. IPF affects {\~{}}3 million people worldwide, with incidence increasing dramatically with age. The diagnostic approach includes the exclusion of other interstitial lung diseases or overlapping conditions and depends on the identification of the UIP pattern, usually with high-resolution CT; lung biopsy might be required in some patients. The UIP pattern is predominantly bilateral, peripheral and with a basal distribution of reticular changes associated with traction bronchiectasis and clusters of subpleural cystic airspaces. The biological processes underlying IPF are thought to reflect an aberrant reparative response to repetitive alveolar epithelial injury in a genetically susceptible ageing individual, although many questions remain on how to define susceptibility. Substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the clinical management of IPF, with the availability of two pharmacotherapeutic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib, that decrease physiological progression and likely improve progression-free survival. Current efforts are directed at identifying IPF early, potentially relying on combinations of biomarkers that include circulating factors, demographics and imaging data. Correspondence},

Here we analyzed the M2 marker expression and intracellular signal transduction in the course of cytokine-driven differentiation. We found elevated spontaneous production of the chemokines CCL17, CCL18 and CCL22 and increased expression of CD206 by alveolar macrophages from patients with lung fibrosis. Stimulation of normal human AM with Th2 cytokines IL-4 and/or IL-10 in vitro revealed IL-4 as the most powerful inducer of M2-phenotype in AM and monocytes. Importantly, IL-10 enhanced IL-4-induced expression of CCL18 and IL-1RA in a synergistic fashion. IL-4/IL-10 stimulation induces a strong activation of STAT3 in AM from fibrosis patients. These results suggest an important role for M2 polarized AM in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and indicate that both IL-4 and IL-10 account for human AM phenotype shift to M2, as seen in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to current therapy and often leads to death. However, the rate of disease progression differs among patients. We hypothesized that comparing the gene expression profiles between patients with stable disease and those in which the disease progressed rapidly will lead to biomarker discovery and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To begin to address this hypothesis, we applied Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate lung expression profiles from diagnostic surgical lung biopsies in 6 individuals with relatively stable (or slowly progressive) IPF and 6 individuals with progressive IPF (based on changes in DLCO and FVC over 12 months). Our results indicate that this comprehensive lung IPF SAGE transcriptome is distinct from normal lung tissue and other chronic lung diseases. To identify candidate markers of disease progression, we compared the IPF SAGE profiles in stable and progressive disease, and identified a set of 102 transcripts that were at least 5-fold up regulated and a set of 89 transcripts that were at least 5-fold down regulated in the progressive group (P-value{\textless}/=0.05). The over expressed genes included surfactant protein A1, two members of the MAPK-EGR-1-HSP70 pathway that regulate cigarette-smoke induced inflammation, and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated), a gene not previously implicated in IPF. Interestingly, 26 of the up regulated genes are also increased in lung adenocarcinomas and have low or no expression in normal lung tissue. More importantly, we defined a SAGE molecular expression signature of 134 transcripts that sufficiently distinguished relatively stable from progressive IPF. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of diagnosis could prove helpful in predicting the likelihood of disease progression or possibly understanding the biological activity of IPF.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless}0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is gradually replacing microarrays for high-throughput studies of gene expression. The main challenge of analyzing microarray data is not in finding differentially expressed genes, but in gaining insights into the biological processes underlying phenotypic differences. To interpret experimental results from microarrays, gene set analysis (GSA) has become the method of choice, in particular because it incorporates pre-existing biological knowledge (in a form of functionally related gene sets) into the analysis. Here we provide a brief review of several statistically different GSA approaches (competitive and self-contained) that can be adapted from microarrays practice as well as those specifically designed for RNA-seq. We evaluate their performance (in terms of Type I error rate, power, robustness to the sample size and heterogeneity, as well as the sensitivity to different types of selection biases) on simulated and real RNA-seq data. Not surprisingly, the performance of various GSA approaches depends only on the statistical hypothesis they test and does not depend on whether the test was developed for microarrays or RNA-seq data. Interestingly, we found that competitive methods have lower power as well as robustness to the samples heterogeneity than self-contained methods, leading to poor results reproducibility. We also found that the power of unsupervised competitive methods depends on the balance between up- and down-regulated genes in tested gene sets. These properties of competitive methods have been overlooked before. Our evaluation provides a concise guideline for selecting GSA approaches, best performing under particular experimental settings in the context of RNA-seq.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the presence of novel subpopulations of pulmonary monocyte-like cells (PMLC) in the human lung; resident PMLC (rPMLC, HLA-DR(+)CD14(++)CD16(+)cells) and inducible PMLC (iPMLC, HLA-DR(+)CD14(++)CD16(-) cells). iPMLC are significantly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following inhalation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have carried out the first functional evaluation of PMLC subpopulations in the inflamed lung, following the isolation of these cells, and other lineages, from BAL fluid using novel and complex protocols. METHODS: iPMLC, rPMLC, alveolar macrophages (AM), neutrophils, and regulatory T cells were quantified in BAL fluid of healthy subjects at 9 hours post-LPS inhalation (n = 15). Cell surface antigen expression by iPMLC, rPMLC and AM and the ability of each lineage to proliferate and to undergo phagocytosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Basal cytokine production by iPMLC compared to AM following their isolation from BAL fluid and the responsiveness of both cell types following in vitro treatment with the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone were assessed. RESULTS: rPMLC have a significantly increased expression of mature macrophage markers and of the proliferation antigen Ki67, compared to iPMLC. Our cytokine data revealed a pro-inflammatory, corticosteroid-resistant phenotype of iPMLC in this model. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasise the presence of functionally distinct subpopulations of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in the human lung in experimental acute lung inflammation.},

abstract = {Background The initiation and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. IL-33, an important cytokine for respiratory diseases, is overexpressed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Objectives We aimed to determine the effects and mechanism of IL-33 on the development and severity of pulmonary fibrosis in murine bleomycin-induced fibrosis.
MethodsLung fibrosis was induced by bleomycin in wild-type or Il33r (St2)-/-C57BL/6 mice treated with the recombinant mature form of IL-33 or anti-IL-33 antibody or transferred with type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). The development and severity of fibrosis was evaluated based on lung histology, collagen levels, and lavage cytology. Cytokine and chemokine levels were quantified by using quantitative PCR, ELISA, and cytometry.
Results IL-33 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells but is induced in macrophages by bleomycin. Bleomycin enhanced the production of the mature but reduced full-length form of IL-33 in lung tissue. ST2 deficiency, anti-IL-33 antibody treatment, or alveolar macrophage depletion attenuated and exogenous IL-33 or adoptive transfer of ILC2s enhanced bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. These pathologic changes were accompanied, respectively, by reduced or increased IL-33, IL-13, TGF-$\beta$1, and inflammatory chemokine production in the lung. Furthermore, IL-33 polarized M2 macrophages to produce IL-13 and TGF-$\beta$1 and induced the expansion of ILC2s to produce IL-13 in vitro and in vivo.
Conclusions IL-33 is a novel profibrogenic cytokine that signals through ST2 to promote the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis by recruiting and directing inflammatory cell function and enhancing profibrogenic cytokine production in an ST2- and macrophage-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Macrophages provide a critical systemic network cells of the innate immune system. Emerging data suggest that in addition, they have important tissue-specific functions that range from clearance of surfactant from the lungs to neuronal pruning and establishment of gut homeostasis. The differentiation and tissue-specific activation of macrophages require precise regulation of gene expression, a process governed by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin structure. We argue that epigenetic regulation of macrophages is determined by lineage- and tissue-specific transcription factors controlled by the built-in programming of myeloid development in combination with signaling from the tissue environment. Perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms of tissue macrophage identity can affect normal macrophage tissue function and contribute to pathologies ranging from obesity and autoimmunity to neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating lung disease of unknown aetiology. Genetic variations in the IL1RN gene, encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), have been associated with IPF susceptibility. Several studies investigated the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or single nucleotide polymorphisms rs408392, rs419598 and rs2637988, with variable results. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of polymorphisms in IL1RN on IPF susceptibility and mRNA expression. We performed a meta-analysis of the five case-control studies that investigated an IL1RN polymorphism in IPF in a Caucasian population. In addition, we investigated whether IL1RN mRNA expression was influenced by IL1RN polymorphisms. The VNTR, rs408392 and rs419598 were in tight linkage disequilibrium, with D' {\textgreater}0.99. Furthermore, rs2637988 was in linkage disequilibrium with the VNTR (D' = 0.90). A haploblock of VNTR*2 and the minor alleles of rs408392and rs419598 was constructed. Meta-analysis revealed that this VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with IPF susceptibility both with an allelic model (odds ratio = 1.42, p = 0.002) and a carriership model (odds ratio = 1.60, p = 0.002). IL1RN mRNA expression was significantly influenced by rs2637988, with lower levels found in carriers of the (minor) GG genotype (p {\textless}0.001). From this meta-analysis, we conclude that the VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with susceptibility to IPF. In addition, polymorphisms in IL1RN influence IL-1Ra mRNA expression, suggesting that lower levels of IL-1Ra predispose to developing IPF. Together these findings demonstrate that the cytokine IL-1Ra plays a role in IPF pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Genomic variation underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) likely involves the interaction and regulation of multiple genes in a network. Data-driven co-expression network module inference has the potential to account for variation within regulatory networks, reduce the dimensionality of RNA-Seq data, and detect significant gene-expression modules associated with depression severity. We performed an RNA-Seq gene co-expression network analysis of mRNA data obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of unmedicated MDD (n = 78) and healthy control (n = 79) subjects. Across the combined MDD and HC groups, we assigned genes into modules using hierarchical clustering with a dynamic tree cut method and projected the expression data onto a lower-dimensional module space by computing the single-sample gene set enrichment score of each module. We tested the single-sample scores of each module for association with levels of depression severity measured by the Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression Scale (MADRS). Independent of MDD status, we identified 23 gene modules from the co-expression network. Two modules were significantly associated with the MADRS score after multiple comparison adjustment (adjusted p = 0.009, 0.028 at 0.05 FDR threshold), and one of these modules replicated in a previous RNA-Seq study of MDD (p = 0.03). The two MADRS-associated modules contain genes previously implicated in mood disorders and show enrichment of apoptosis and B cell receptor signaling. The genes in these modules show a correlation between network centrality and univariate association with depression, suggesting that intramodular hub genes are more likely to be related to MDD compared to other genes in a module.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that mice that are genetically deficient in the CCR2 gene (CCR2-/- mice) are protected from fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced lung fibrosis. Protection from fibrosis correlated with impaired recruitment of fibrocytes (bone marrow-derived cells, which share both leukocyte and mesenchymal markers). There are three ligands for CCR2 in the mouse: CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12. CCL2 and CCL12 are both elevated in the lung after FITC injury, but with different kinetics. CCL2 is maximal at Day 1 and absent by Day 7 after FITC. In contrast, CCL12 peaks at Day 3, but remains elevated through Day 21 after FITC. We now demonstrate that while CCR2-/- mice are protected from FITC-induced fibrosis, CCL2-/- mice are not. CCL2-/- mice are able to recruit fibrocytes to FITC-injured airspaces, unlike CCR2-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of CCR2-expressing fibrocytes augments FITC-induced fibrosis in both wild-type and CCR2-/- mice, suggesting that these cells play a pathogenic role in the disease process. Both CCL2 and CCL12 are chemotactic for fibrocytes. However, neutralization of CCL12 in wild-type mice significantly protects from FITC-induced fibrosis, whereas neutralization of CCL2 was less effective. Thus, CCL12 is likely the CCR2 ligand responsible for driving fibroproliferation in the mouse.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes reportedly play important roles in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic agent; however, its effects on fibrocytes have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pirfenidone inhibits fibrocyte pool size in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. METHODS: Bleomycin (100 mg/kg) was infused with osmotic pumps into C57BL/6 mice, and pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily for 2 wk. The lungs were removed, and single-cell suspensions were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to detect fibrocytes, which were defined as CD45 and collagen-I double-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the lung specimens to quantify fibrocytes. Chemokines in the lung digests were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of pirfenidone on alveolar macrophages was evaluated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In a therapeutic setting, pirfenidone administration was initiated 10 days after bleomycin treatment. For chemotaxis assay, lung fibrocytes were isolated with immunomagnetic selection (CD45-positive mesenchymal cells) after culture and allowed to migrate toward chemokines in the presence or absence of pirfenidone. Moreover, the effect of pirfenidone on the expression of chemokine receptors on fibrocytes was evaluated. RESULTS: Pirfenidone significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis as assessed with quantitative histology and collagen measurement. Fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mice lungs was attenuated from 26.5{\%} to 13.7{\%} by pirfenidone on FACS analysis. This outcome was also observed in a therapeutic setting. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrocytes were significantly decreased by pirfenidone administration compared with those in bleomycin-treated mice (P = 0.0097). Increased chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) and CCL12 production in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs was significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (P = 0.0003 and P {\textless}0.0001, respectively). Pirfenidone also attenuated macrophage counts stimulated by bleomycin in BAL fluid. Fibrocyte migration toward CCL2 and chemokine (CC motif) receptor-2 expression on fibrocytes was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone attenuated the fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs via attenuation of CCL2 and CCL12 production in vivo, and fibrocyte migration was inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. Fibrocyte inhibition is considered a mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of pirfenidone.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 the American Physiological Society.Nitrogen mustard (NM) is a vesicant that causes lung injury and fibrosis, accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we analyzed the spleen as a source of these cells. Splenectomized (SPX) and sham control rats were treated intratracheally with NM (0.125 mg/kg) or PBS control. Macrophage responses were analyzed 1–7 days later. Splenectomy resulted in an increase in lung macrophages expressing CCR2, but a decrease in ATR-1a+ cells, receptors important in bone marrow and spleen monocyte trafficking, respectively. Splenectomy was also associated with an increase in proinflammatory M1 (iNOS+, CD11b+CD43+) macrophages in lungs of NM-treated rats, as well as greater upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression. Conversely, a decrease in CD11b+CD43+ M2 macrophages was observed in SPX rats, with no changes in CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, or YM-1+ M2 macrophages, suggesting distinct origins of M2 subpopulations responding to NM. Macrophage expression of M2 genes including IL-10, ApoE, PTX-2, PTX-3, 5-HT2a, and 5-HT7 was also reduced in NM-treated SPX rats compared with shams, indicating impaired M2 activity. Changes in lung macrophages responding to NM as a consequence of splenectomy were correlated with exacerbated tissue injury and more rapid fibrogenesis. These data demonstrate that the spleen is a source of a subset of M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory activity; moreover, in their absence, proinflammatory/ cytotoxic M1 macrophages predominate in the lung, resulting in heightened pathology. Understanding the origin of macrophages and characterizing their phenotype after vesicant exposure may lead to more targeted therapeutics aimed at reducing toxicity and disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains a major cause of morbidity in immunocompromised hosts. This is due to the inability of the host immunity to respond appropriately to Aspergillus. An established risk factor for IA is neutropenia which is encountered by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Herein we investigate the role of neutrophils in modulating host response to Aspergillus. We found that neutrophils had the propensity to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production but through different mechanisms for specific cytokines. Cellular contact was requisite for the modulation of interleukin-1 beta production by Aspergillus with the involvement of complement receptor 3. On the other hand, inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production (TNF-$\alpha$) was cell contact-independent and mediated by secreted myeloperoxidase (MPO). Specifically, the inhibition of TNF-$\alpha$ by MPO was through the TLR4 pathway and involved interference with the mRNA transcription of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) / interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). Our study illustrates the extended immune modulatory role of neutrophils beyond its primary phagocytic function. The absence of neutrophils and loss of its inhibitory effect on cytokine production explains the hypercytokinemia seen in neutropenic patients when infected with Aspergillus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes in time course RNA-Seq data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of transcriptional regulatory network. However, most of the available methods treat gene expressions at different time points as replicates and test the significance of the mean expression difference between treatments or conditions irrespective of time. They thus fail to identify many DE genes with different profiles across time. In this article, we propose a negative binomial mixed-effect model (NBMM) to identify DE genes in time course RNA-Seq data. In the NBMM, mean gene expression is characterized by a fixed effect, and time dependency is described by random effects. The NBMM is very flexible and can be fitted to both unreplicated and replicated time course RNA-Seq data via a penalized likelihood method. By comparing gene expression profiles over time, we further classify the DE genes into two subtypes to enhance the understanding of expression dynamics. A significance test for detecting DE genes is derived using a Kullback-Leibler distance ratio. Additionally, a significance test for gene sets is developed using a gene set score. RESULTS Simulation analysis shows that the NBMM outperforms currently available methods for detecting DE genes and gene sets. Moreover, our real data analysis of fruit fly developmental time course RNA-Seq data demonstrates the NBMM identifies biologically relevant genes which are well justified by gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method is powerful and efficient to detect biologically relevant DE genes and gene sets in time course RNA-Seq data.},

abstract = {Background: Gut microbiota likely impact obesity and metabolic diseases. We evaluated the changes in gut microbiota after surgical versus medical weight loss in adults with diabetes and obesity. Methods: We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify the gut microbial composition at baseline and at 10{\%} weight loss in adults with diabetes who were randomized to medical weight loss (MWL, n = 4), adjustable gastric banding (AGB, n = 4), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 4). Results: All participants were female, 75{\%} reported black race with mean age of 51 years. At similar weight loss amount and glycemic improvement, the RYGB group had the most number of bacterial species (10 increased, 1 decreased) that significantly changed (p {\textless} 0.05) in relative abundance. Alpha-diversity at follow-up was significantly lower in AGB group compared to MWL and RYGB (observed species for AGB vs. MWL, p = 0.0093; AGB vs. RYGB, p = 0.0093). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increased in 3 participants after RYGB, 1 after AGB, and 1 after MWL. Conclusions: At similar weight loss and glycemic improvement, the greatest alteration in gut microbiota occurred after RYGB with an increase in the potentially beneficial bacterium, F. prausnitzii. Gut microbial diversity tended to decrease after AGB and increase after RYGB and MWL. Future studies are needed to determine the impact and durability of gut microbial changes over time and their role in long-term metabolic improvement after bariatric surgery in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Distinctly expressed genes that could distinguish IPF from sarcoidosis are more enriched in processes of cilium biogenesis or degradation and regulating T cell activations.

abstract = {In addition to the directly mutagenic effects of energy deposition in DNA, ionizing radiation is associated with a variety of untargeted and delayed effects that result in ongoing bone marrow damage. Delayed effects are genotype dependent with CBA/Ca mice, but not C57BL/6 mice, susceptible to the induction of damage and also radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrophages are a potential source of ongoing damaging signals, we have determined their gene expression profiles and we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages show widely different intrinsic expression patterns. The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure.},

Although monocytes and antigen-specific CD4 T cells contribute to defense against inhaled fungal spores, how these cells interact during infection remains undefined. Investigating the role of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells during fungal infection, we find that A. fumigatus infection induces an influx of chemokine receptor CCR2- and Ly6C-expressing inflammatory monocytes into lungs and draining lymph nodes. Depletion of CCR2+cells reduced A. fumigatus conidial transport from lungs to draining lymph nodes, abolished CD4 T cell priming following respiratory challenge, and impaired pulmonary fungal clearance. In contrast, depletion of CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes during systemic fungal infection did not prevent CD4 T cell priming in the spleen. Our findings demonstrate that pulmonary CD4 T cell responses to inhaled spores require CCR2+Ly6Chimonocytes and their derivatives, revealing a compartmentally restricted function for these cells in adaptive respiratory immune responses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To validate its prognostic utility, we did a tissue microarray analysis on a cohort of 139 consecutive invasive carcinomas (n = 417 tissue samples) immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against GATA3. Low GATA3 expression was associated with higher histologic grade (P {\textless} 0.001), positive nodes (P = 0.002), larger tumor size (P = 0.03), negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (P {\textless} 0.001 for both), and HER2-neu overexpression (P = 0.03). Patients whose tumors expressed low GATA3 had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival when compared with those whose tumors had high GATA3 levels. The hazard ratio of metastasis or recurrence according to the GATA3 status was 0.31 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.13-0.74; P = 0.009). Cox multivariate analysis showed that GATA3 had independent prognostic significance above and beyond conventional variables.

This was a retrospective review of 461 patients with IPF (269 cases were biopsy-proven). The median follow-up period was 22.9 months. Rapid deterioration requiring hospitalisation occurred in 163 (35.4{\%}) patients, with multiple episodes in 42 patients. Acute exacerbation was the most frequent cause (55.2{\%}), followed by infection. The 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low forced vital capacity (FVC) were significant risk factors. The in-hospital mortality rate was 50.0{\%}, and the 1- and 5-yr survival rates from the initial diagnosis were 56.2 and 18.4{\%}, respectively. Acute exacerbation was a significant predictor of poor survival after the initial diagnosis, along with increased age, low FVC and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and steroid use with or without cytotoxic therapy. 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low FVC were risk factors. Acute exacerbation had a serious impact on the overall survival of the patients with IPF.},

abstract = {Fibrosis or scarring of diverse organs and tissues is considered as a pathologic consequence of a chronically altered wound healing response which is tightly linked to inflammation and angiogenesis. The recruitment of immune cells, local proliferation of fibroblasts and the consecutive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins are common pathophysiological hallmarks of tissue fibrosis, irrespective of the organ involved. Chemokines, a family of chemotactic cytokines, appear to be central mediators of the initiation as well as progression of these biological processes. Traditionally chemokines have only been considered to play a critical role in orchestrating the influx of immune cells to sites of tissue injury. However, within the last years, further aspects of chemokine biology including fibroblast activation and angiogenesis have been deciphered in tissue fibrosis of many different organs. Interestingly, certain chemokines appear to mediate common effects in liver, kidney, lung, and skin of various animal models, while others mediate tissue specific effects. These aspects have to be kept in mind when extrapolating data of animal studies to early human trials. Nevertheless, the further understanding of chemokine effects in tissue fibrosis might be an attractive approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets in chronic organ damage associated with high morbidity and mortality.

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Monocytes are highly plastic and heterogeneous, and change their functional phenotype in response to environmental stimulation. Evidence from murine and human studies has suggested that monocytosis can be an indicator of various inflammatory diseases. Monocytes can differentiate into inflammatory or anti-inflammatory subsets. Upon tissue damage or infection, monocytes are rapidly recruited to the tissue, where they can differentiate into tissue macrophages or dendritic cells. Given the rapid progress in monocyte research from broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases, there is a need to summarize our knowledge in monocyte heterogeneity and its impact in human disease. In this review, we describe the current understanding of heterogeneity of human and murine monocytes, the function of distinct subsets of monocytes, and a potential mechanism for monocyte differentiation. We emphasize that inflammatory monocyte subsets are valuable biomarkers for inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular diseases.},

We studied the global gene expression signature of acute exacerbations of IPF.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nOBJECTIVES: To understand the gene expression patterns of acute exacerbations of IPF.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: RNA was extracted from 23 stable IPF lungs, 8 IPF lungs with acute exacerbation (IPF-AEx), and 15 control lungs and used for hybridization on Agilent gene expression microarrays. Functional analysis of genes was performed with Spotfire and Genomica. Gene validations for MMP1, MMP7, AGER, DEFA1-3, COL1A2, and CCNA2 were performed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling assays were performed on the same tissues used for the microarray. ELISA for alpha-defensins was performed on plasma from control subjects, patients with stable IPF, and patients with IPF-AEx.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in IPF-AEx and IPF samples were similar for the genes that distinguish IPF from control lungs. Five hundred and seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate {\textless}5{\%}) between stable IPF and IPF-AEx. Functional analysis of these genes did not indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes. CCNA2 and alpha-defensin protein levels were also higher and localized to the epithelium of IPF-AEx, where widespread apoptosis was also detected. alpha-Defensin protein levels were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF-AEx.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPF-AEx is characterized by enhanced epithelial injury and proliferation, as reflected by increases in CCNA2 and alpha-defensins and apoptosis of epithelium. The concomitant increase in alpha-defensins in the peripheral blood and lungs may suggest their use as biomarkers for this disorder.},

Like the biblical Tower of Babel, macrophage activation encompasses a panoply of descriptors used in different ways. The lack of consensus on how to define macrophage activation in experiments invitro and invivo impedes progress in multiple ways, including the fact that many researchers still consider there to be only two types of activated macrophages, often termed M1 and M2. Here, we describe a set of standards encompassing three principles-the source of macrophages, definition of the activators, and a consensus collection of markers to describe macrophage activation-with the goal of unifying experimental standards for diverse experimental scenarios. Collectively, we propose a common framework for macrophage-activation nomenclature. The description of macrophage activation status is contentious and confusing.

abstract = {Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and inter-connectivity of com- puter technology is creating unprecedented quantities of digital data. Data mining, the science of extracting useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as a young and interdisciplinary field in computer science. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, en- gineering and government, and it is widely believed that data mining will have profound impact on our society. The growing consensus that data mining can bring real value has led to an explosion in demand for novel data mining technologies and for students who are trained in data mining—students who have an understanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to real-life problems, and are trained for research and development of new data mining methods. Courses in data mining have started to sprawl all over the world. Based on this development of the field, the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee has set up the ACM SIGKDD Curriculum Committee to design a sample curriculum for data mining that gives recommendations for educating the next generation of students in data mining. Based on feedback from researchers, educators, and students, we are convinced that it is an important task to have a carefully designed, conceptually strong, technically rich, and balanced curriculum for this discipline. A comprehensive and balanced curriculum will ensure that the education in data mining sets a solid foundation for the healthy growth of the field, and it will promote systematic training of students in computer science, information sciences, and other related fields, and it will provide guidance for the training of the next generation of data mining researchers, developers and technology users. The Curriculum Committee is composed of university professors and researchers who have actively con- tributed to data mining research and education, researchers and practitioners from industry who have rich experiences in applying data mining technology, and administrators from government agencies. This report is the first draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Committee. We expect that this draft will be extensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forward to suggestions and recommendations from the Committee and from the general data mining research, development, and application community. The remainder of this report is structured as follows. First, we outline the principles that guided us in the selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief description of the prerequisites that we assume students of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Section 4 contains the core of this document, our curriculum proposal},

abstract = {The B7 family consists of structurally related, cell-surface protein ligands, which bind to receptors on lymphocytes that regulate immune responses. Activation of T and B lymphocytes is initiated by engagement of cell-surface, antigen-specific T-cell receptors or B-cell receptors, but additional signals delivered simultaneously by B7 ligands determine the ultimate immune response. These 'costimulatory' or 'coinhibitory' signals are delivered by B7 ligands through the CD28 family of receptors on lymphocytes. Interaction of B7-family members with costimulatory receptors augments immune responses, and interaction with coinhibitory receptors attenuates immune responses. There are currently seven known members of the family: B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), inducible costimulator ligand (ICOS-L), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), programmed death-2 ligand (PD-L2), B7-H3, and B7-H4. Members of the family have been characterized predominantly in humans and mice, but some members are also found in birds. They share 20-40{\%} amino-acid identity and are structurally related, with the extracellular domain containing tandem domains related to variable and constant immunoglobulin domains. B7 ligands are expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The importance of the family in regulating immune responses is shown by the development of immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases in mice with mutations in B7-family genes. Manipulation of the signals delivered by B7 ligands has shown potential in the treatment of autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

abstract = {The lung hosts multiple populations of macrophages and dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in lung pathology. The accurate identification and enumeration of these subsets are essential for understanding their role in lung pathology. Flow cytometry is a mainstream tool for studying the immune system. However, a systematic flow cytometric approach to identify subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) accurately and consistently in the normal mouse lung has not been described. Here we developed a panel of surface markers and an analysis strategy that accurately identify all known populations of macrophages and DCs, and their precursors in the lung during steady-state conditions and bleomycin-induced injury. Using this panel, we assessed the polarization of lung macrophages during the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Alveolar macrophages expressed markers of alternatively activated macrophages during both acute and fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury, whereas markers of classically activated macrophages were expressed only during the acute phase. Taken together, these data suggest that this flow cytometric panel is very helpful in identifying macrophage and DC populations and their state of activation in normal, injured, and fibrotic lungs.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

Using mass spectrometry and bone marrow-derived cells, we provided a global view of the proteomes of M-CSF-derived macrophages, classically and alternatively activated macrophages, and GM-CSF-derived DCs. Remarkably, the expression levels of half the plasma membrane proteins differed significantly in the various populations of cells derived in vitro. Moreover, the membrane proteomes of macrophages and DCs were more distinct than those of classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Hierarchical cluster and dual statistical analyses demonstrated that each cell type exhibited a robust proteomic signature that was unique. To interrogate the phenotype of myeloid cells in vivo, we subjected elicited peritoneal macrophages harvested from wild-type and GM-CSF-deficient mice to mass spectrometric and functional analysis. Unexpectedly, we found that peritoneal macrophages exhibited many features of the DCs generated in vitro. These findings demonstrate that global analysis of the membrane proteome can help define immune cell phenotypes in vivo.},

Clustering, however, can also stratify patients by similarity of their gene expression profiles, thereby defining novel disease entities based on molecular characteristics.

abstract = {Gene set enrichment (GSE) analyses play an important role in the interpretation of large-scale transcriptome datasets. Multiple GSE tools can be integrated into a single method as obtaining optimal results is challenging due to the plethora of GSE tools and their discrepant performances. Several existing ensemble methods lead to different scores in sorting pathways as integrated results; furthermore, it is difficult for users to choose a single ensemble score to obtain optimal final results. Here, we develop an ensemble method using a machine learning approach called Combined Gene set analysis incorporating Prioritization and Sensitivity (CGPS) that integrates the results provided by nine prominent GSE tools into a single ensemble score (R score) to sort pathways as integrated results. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, CGPS is the first GSE ensemble method built based on a priori knowledge of pathways and phenotypes. Compared with 10 widely used individual methods and five types of ensemble scores from two ensemble methods, we demonstrate that sorting pathways based on the R score can better prioritize relevant pathways, as established by an evaluation of 120 simulated datasets and 45 real datasets. Additionally, CGPS is applied to expression data involving the drug panobinostat, which is an anticancer treatment against multiple myeloma. The results identify cell processes associated with cancer, such as the p53 signaling pathway (hsa04115); by contrast, according to two ensemble methods (EnrichmentBrowser and EGSEA), this pathway has a rank higher than 20, which may cause users to miss the pathway in their analyses. We show that this method, which is based on a priori knowledge, can capture valuable biological information from numerous types of gene set collections, such as KEGG pathways, GO terms, Reactome, and BioCarta. CGPS is publicly available as a standalone source code at ftp://ftp.cbi.pku.edu.cn/pub/CGPS{\_}download/cgps-1.0.0.tar.gz.},

abstract = {Dysregulated inflammasome activation contributes to respiratory infections and pathologic airway inflammation. Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

abstract = {Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive loss of the alveolar integrity, recruitment, and activation of myofibroblast, and excessive collagen deposition that resulted in loss of parenchymal architecture and lung function. Although etiology is unknown, major risk factor of disease development is represented by cigarette smoke or exposure to dust. Aims: Aim of this proteomic study was to compare broncho alveolar lavage fluid protein profiles of IPF patients, never-smoker healthy control (nonsmoker control) and smoker control subjects in order to investigate proteins potentially related to disease progression and pathogenesis. Methods: Broncho alveolar lavage fluid samples were resolved using 2D-PAGE and the differentially expressed proteins were identified by MS. The performed PCA statistically proved the correlation existing between differentially expressed spots in the three groups. Functional analysis of the identified proteins was performed by pathway and enrichment analysis by MetaCore and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Results: Interestingly, transcriptional factors NF-kB, PPARgamma, and c-myc emerged as well as a group of functional hubs. Enrichment analysis suggested that Gene Ontology (GO) process networks and pathway maps involved in IPF included angiotensin system maturation, renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, heme metabolism, coagulation system, response to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and iron transport. Conclusion: In conclusion, the combination of proteomic data with system biology platforms allowed us to amplify the information obtained processing the results and indicated the principal pathways involved. These information can point to potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets opening the way for further analysis.},

abstract = {Although acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has become well recognised, the reported incidence and outcomes are highly variable, and risk factors are unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence, risk factors and impact of acute exacerbations, and other known causes of rapid deterioration. This was a retrospective review of 461 patients with IPF (269 cases were biopsy-proven). The median follow-up period was 22.9 months. Rapid deterioration requiring hospitalisation occurred in 163 (35.4{\%}) patients, with multiple episodes in 42 patients. Acute exacerbation was the most frequent cause (55.2{\%}), followed by infection. The 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low forced vital capacity (FVC) were significant risk factors. The in-hospital mortality rate was 50.0{\%}, and the 1- and 5-yr survival rates from the initial diagnosis were 56.2 and 18.4{\%}, respectively. Acute exacerbation was a significant predictor of poor survival after the initial diagnosis, along with increased age, low FVC and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and steroid use with or without cytotoxic therapy. 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low FVC were risk factors. Acute exacerbation had a serious impact on the overall survival of the patients with IPF.},

It offers several advantages over t-test based methods and accepts pre-processed expression datasets produced from a wide variety of platforms. The significance of the detection is assessed by a non-parametric permutation test, and the associated P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) are included in the output alongside the genes that are detected by user-defined criteria. A visualization plot is provided to view actual expression levels for each gene with estimated significance measurements. AVAILABILITY: RankProd is available at Bioconductor http://www.bioconductor.org. A web-based interface will soon be available at http://cactus.salk.edu/RankProd},

abstract = {Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in type 2 immunity. Mice deficient in ST2, a receptor for the latest member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, have impaired type 2 immune responses. We therefore reasoned that IL-33/ST2 signaling may be involved in the differentiation and activation of AAM during airway inflammation. We report here that IL-33 changed the quiescent phenotype of alveolar macrophages toward an AAM phenotype that expressed mannose receptor, IL-4Ralpha, and produced high levels of CCL24 and CCL17 in an IL-13-dependent manner during IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Neutralization of AAM-derived CCL24 led to an amelioration of IL-33-induced eosinophilia in the lungs. Moreover, depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Additionally, the attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation in ST2(-/-) mice was associated with a decrease in AAM differentiation. In vitro, IL-33 amplified IL-13-induced polarization of alveolar- and bone marrow-derived macrophage toward an AAM phenotype by increasing the expression of arginase I, Ym1, as well as the production of CCL24 and CCL17. IL-13/IL-4Ralpha signaling was crucial for IL-33-driven AAM amplification by inducing the expression of ST2L. Finally, we showed that IL-33 was more abundantly expressed in the lung epithelial cells of asthma patients than those from healthy controls, suggesting that IL-33 may be involved in lung macrophage activation in clinical asthma. Taken together, we demonstrate here that IL-33/ST2 plays a significant role in the amplification of AAM polarization and chemokine production which contribute to innate and Ag-induced airway inflammation.},

However, the mechanisms by which IL-9/Th9 mediate immunopathology in the lung are unknown. Here we report an IL-9-driven positive feedback loop that reinforces allergic inflammation. We show that IL-9 increases IL-2 production by mast cells, which leads to expansion of CD25+ type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and subsequent activation of Th9 cells. Blocking IL-9 or inhibiting CD117 (c-Kit) signalling counteracts the pathogenic effect of the described IL-9-mast cell-IL-2 signalling axis. Overproduction of IL-9 is observed in expectorates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and a sex-specific variant of IL-9 is predictive of allergic reactions in female patients. Our results suggest that blocking IL-9 may be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate inflammation associated with microbial colonization in the lung, and offers a plausible explanation for gender differences in clinical outcomes of patients with CF.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients. In the immunocompetent host, inhaled conidia are cleared by alveolar macrophages. The signaling pathways of the alveolar macrophage involved in the clearance of A. fumigatus are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of TLRs in the immune response against A. fumigatus and their contribution to the signaling events triggered in murine alveolar macrophages upon infection with A. fumigatus conidia. Specifically, we examined the MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation and cytokine signaling. Our investigations revealed that immunocompetent TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were not more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis as compared with wild-type mice and that the in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK and p38 was not affected in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 knockout mice following stimulation with conidia. In vivo experiments suggest that ERK was an essential MAPK in the defense against A. fumigatus, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB appeared to play only a secondary role. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLR2/4 recognition and MyD88 signaling are dispensable for the clearance of A. fumigatus under immunocompetent situations. Furthermore, our data stress the important role of ERK activation in innate immunity to A. fumigatus.},

We found that treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts (PHLFs) with conditioned media from damaged lung epithelial cells significantly upregulated interleukin IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression (P{\textless}0.05).

The OA complex of the IgG prepared by the heat-treatment procedure comprised of protein monomers and oligomers with bound OA. The IgG in the complexes retained most secondary but only partial tertiary structure and complex formation with OA did not abolish the ability of anti-erythrocyte IgG to bind to the erythrocytes. Anti-erythrocyte IgG-OA complexes were remarkably more hemolytic than those prepared using non-specific IgG, while complexes prepared using affinity purified anti-erythrocyte IgG were most effective in hemolyzing the cells. The work suggests that antibodies that exhibit affinity towards target cells may be useful in the preparation of selective and highly toxic OA complexes for the cells.},

We show that specific genetic deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages after their recruitment to the lung ameliorated lung fibrosis, whereas tissue-resident alveolar macrophages did not contribute to fibrosis. Using transcriptomic profiling of flow-sorted cells, we found that monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation unfolds continuously over the course of fibrosis and its resolution. During the fibrotic phase, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages differ significantly from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in their expression of profibrotic genes. A population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages persisted in the lung for one year after the resolution of fibrosis, where they became increasingly similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Human homologues of profibrotic genes expressed by mouse monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during fibrosis were up-regulated in human alveolar macrophages from fibrotic compared with normal lungs. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting alveolar macrophage differentiation within the lung may ameliorate fibrosis without the adverse consequences associated with global monocyte or tissue-resident alveolar macrophage depletion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a heterogeneous macrophage response that when experimentally polarized toward alternative forms of activation (M2 macrophages) promotes tissue and functional recovery. There are limited pharmacological therapies that can drive this reparative inflammatory state. In the current study, we used in vitro systems to comprehensively defined markers of macrophages with known pathological (M1) and reparative (M2) properties in SCI. We then used these markers to objectively define the macrophage activation states after SCI in response to delayed azithromycin treatment. Mice were subjected to moderate-severe thoracic contusion SCI. Azithromycin or vehicle was administered beginning 30 minutes post-SCI and then daily for 3 or 7 days post injury (dpi). We detected a dose-dependent polarization toward purportedly protective M2 macrophages with daily AZM treatment. Specifically, AZM doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg decreased M1 macrophage gene expression at 3 dpi while the lowest (10 mg/kg) and highest (160 mg/kg) doses increased M2 macrophage gene expression at 7 dpi. Azithromycin has documented immunomodulatory properties and is commonly prescribed to treat infections in SCI individuals. This work demonstrates the utility of objective, comprehensive macrophage gene profiling for evaluating immunomodulatory SCI therapies and highlights azithromycin as a promising agent for SCI treatment. Spinal cord injury (SCI) activates CNS macrophages consisting of endogenous microglia and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells have pathological properties and contribute to neurodegeneration and tissue loss subsequent to the initial mechanical trauma. Activated macrophages also have the potential to promote tissue remodeling and axon regeneration 1–3 and there is growing evidence that transgenic, viral, or transplantation-mediated alterations in macrophage phenotype in SCI can be therapeutic 4 . The development of clinically viable, pharmacological interventions that harness the reparative potential of macrophages responding to SCI, however, remains a challenge facing the SCI community. To date, only one pharmacological agent, meth-ylprednisolone, is approved to treat SCI and its use is controversial. Increasingly, well-tolerated, pharmacological agents with immunomodulatory properties are being sought as therapies for SCI. Azithromycin (AZM) is a semisynthetic derivative of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin with significant immunomodulatory actions independent of is antibacterial properties 5,6},

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of identifying differentially expressed groups of genes from a microarray experiment. The groups of genes are ex-ternally defined, for example, sets of gene pathways derived from biological databases. Our starting point is the interesting Gene Set Enrichment Analy-sis (GSEA) procedure of Subramanian et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 15545–15550]. We study the problem in some generality and propose two potential improvements to GSEA: the maxmean statistic for summarizing gene-sets, and restandardization for more accurate inferences. We discuss a variety of examples and extensions, including the use of gene-set scores for class predictions. We also describe a new R language package GSA that im-plements our ideas. 1. Introduction. We discuss the problem of identifying differentially ex-pressed groups of genes from a set of microarray experiments. In the usual situation we have N genes measured on n microarrays, under two different ex-perimental conditions, such as control and treatment. The number of genes N is usually large, say, at least a few thousand, while the number samples n is smaller, say, a hundred or fewer. This problem is an example of multiple hypothesis testing with a large number of tests, one that often arises in genomic and proteomic ap-plications, and also in signal processing. We focus mostly on the gene expression problem, but our proposed methods are more widely applicable. Most approaches start by computing a two-sample t-statistic z j for each gene. Genes having t-statistics larger than a pre-defined cutoff (in absolute value) are declared significant, and then the family-wise error rate or false discovery rate of the resulting gene list is assessed by comparing the tail area from a null distribution of the statistic. This null distribution is derived from data permutations, or from asymptotic theory. In an interesting and useful paper, Subramanian et al. (2005) proposed a method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for assessing the significance of pre-defined gene-sets, rather than individual genes. The gene-sets can be derived from different sources, for example, the sets of genes representing biological pathways},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Humans are genetically unable to produce the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), because of a mutation that occurred after our last common ancestor with great apes. Although Neu5Gc is presumed absent from normal humans, small amounts have been claimed to exist in human tumors and fetal meconium. We have generated an antibody with high specificity and avidity for Neu5Gc. Fetal tissues, normal adult tissues, and breast carcinomas from humans showed reactivity to this antibody, primarily within secretory epithelia and blood vessels. The presence of small amounts of Neu5Gc was confirmed by MS. Absent any known alternate pathway for its synthesis, we reasoned that these small amounts of Neu5Gc might originate from exogenous sources. Indeed, human cells fed with Neu5Gc incorporated it into endogenous glycoproteins. When normal human volunteers ingested Neu5Gc, a portion was absorbed and eliminated in urine, and small quantities were incorporated into newly synthesized glycoproteins. Neu5Gc has never been reported in plants or microbes to our knowledge. We found that Neu5Gc is rare in poultry and fish, common in milk products, and enriched in red meats. Furthermore, normal humans have variable amounts of circulating IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies against Neu5Gc, with the highest levels comparable to those of the previously known anti-alpha-galactose xenoreactive antibodies. This finding represents an instance wherein humans absorb and metabolically incorporate a nonhuman dietary component enriched in foods of mammalian origin, even while generating xenoreactive, and potentially autoreactive, antibodies against the same molecule. Potential implications for human diseases are briefly discussed.},

Furthermore, the manuscripts should provide sufficient motivation, examples and applications. This clearly distinguishes Lecture Notes from journal articles or technical reports which normally are very concise.

abstract = {The systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic disorders collectively represent one of the most serious health problems world-wide causing a large proportion of the total world population mortality. The molecular pathways involved in their pathogenesis are complex and despite intensive investigations have not been fully elucidated. Whereas chronic inflammatory cell infiltration is universally present in fibrotic lesions, the central role of monocytes and macrophages as regulators of inflammation and fibrosis has only recently become apparent. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to the initiation, establishment, or progression of the fibrotic process remain largely unknown. Several monocyte and macrophage subpopulations have been identified, with certain phenotypes promoting inflammation whereas others display profibrotic effects. Given the unmet need for effective treatments for fibroproliferative diseases and the crucial regulatory role of monocyte/macrophage subpopulations in fibrogenesis, the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific monocyte/macrophage subpopulations has become increasingly attractive. We will provide here an overview of the current understanding of the role of monocyte/macrophage phenotype subpopulations in animal models of tissue fibrosis and in various systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, we will discuss recent approaches to the design of effective anti-fibrotic therapeutic interventions by targeting the phenotypic differences identified between the various monocyte and macrophage subpopulations.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating lung disease of unknown aetiology. Genetic variations in the IL1RN gene, encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), have been associated with IPF susceptibility. Several studies investigated the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) or single nucleotide polymorphisms rs408392, rs419598 and rs2637988, with variable results. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of polymorphisms in IL1RN on IPF susceptibility and mRNA expression. We performed a meta-analysis of the five case-control studies that investigated an IL1RN polymorphism in IPF in a Caucasian population. In addition, we investigated whether IL1RN mRNA expression was influenced by IL1RN polymorphisms. The VNTR, rs408392 and rs419598 were in tight linkage disequilibrium, with D' {\textgreater}0.99. Furthermore, rs2637988 was in linkage disequilibrium with the VNTR (D' = 0.90). A haploblock of VNTR*2 and the minor alleles of rs408392and rs419598 was constructed. Meta-analysis revealed that this VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with IPF susceptibility both with an allelic model (odds ratio = 1.42, p = 0.002) and a carriership model (odds ratio = 1.60, p = 0.002). IL1RN mRNA expression was significantly influenced by rs2637988, with lower levels found in carriers of the (minor) GG genotype (p {\textless}0.001). From this meta-analysis, we conclude that the VNTR*2 haploblock is associated with susceptibility to IPF. In addition, polymorphisms in IL1RN influence IL-1Ra mRNA expression, suggesting that lower levels of IL-1Ra predispose to developing IPF. Together these findings demonstrate that the cytokine IL-1Ra plays a role in IPF pathogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and variable clinical course. Although matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is emerging as an important IPF biomarker, reproducibility across studies is unclear. We aimed to determine whether a previously reported prognostic threshold for MMP-7 was predictive of mortality in an independent cohort of IPF patients. METHODS MMP-7 concentrations obtained from heparinized plasma samples were determined by ELISA in 97 patients with IPF and 41 healthy controls. The association of the previously published heparin plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL with all-cause mortality or transplant-free survival (TFS) was determined, either as an independent biomarker or as part of the modified personal clinical and molecular mortality index (m-PCMI). RESULTS MMP-7 plasma concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to healthy controls (14.40 ± 6.55 ng/mL vs 6.03 ± 2.51 ng/mL, P {\textless}0.001). The plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality and TFS (unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) = 25.85 and 15.49, 95{\%} CI: 10.91-61.23 and 5.41-44.34, respectively, P {\textless}0.001). MMP-7 concentrations, split by 12.1 ng/mL, were significantly (P {\textless}0.05) predictive of mortality and TFS after adjusting for age, gender, smoking and baseline pulmonary function parameters, in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. MMP-7 concentrations were negatively correlated with diffusing lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO ) (r = -0.21, P = 0.02), and positively with a mortality risk scoring system (GAP) that combines age, gender, forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO (r = 0.32, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This study confirms that MMP-7 concentrations could be used to accurately predict outcomes across cohorts and centres, when similar collection protocols are applied.},

abstract = {Background The initiation and regulation of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. IL-33, an important cytokine for respiratory diseases, is overexpressed in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Objectives We aimed to determine the effects and mechanism of IL-33 on the development and severity of pulmonary fibrosis in murine bleomycin-induced fibrosis. MethodsLung fibrosis was induced by bleomycin in wild-type or Il33r (St2)-/-C57BL/6 mice treated with the recombinant mature form of IL-33 or anti-IL-33 antibody or transferred with type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). The development and severity of fibrosis was evaluated based on lung histology, collagen levels, and lavage cytology. Cytokine and chemokine levels were quantified by using quantitative PCR, ELISA, and cytometry. Results IL-33 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells but is induced in macrophages by bleomycin. Bleomycin enhanced the production of the mature but reduced full-length form of IL-33 in lung tissue. ST2 deficiency, anti-IL-33 antibody treatment, or alveolar macrophage depletion attenuated and exogenous IL-33 or adoptive transfer of ILC2s enhanced bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. These pathologic changes were accompanied, respectively, by reduced or increased IL-33, IL-13, TGF-{\$}\beta{\$}1, and inflammatory chemokine production in the lung. Furthermore, IL-33 polarized M2 macrophages to produce IL-13 and TGF-{\$}\beta{\$}1 and induced the expansion of ILC2s to produce IL-13 in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions IL-33 is a novel profibrogenic cytokine that signals through ST2 to promote the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis by recruiting and directing inflammatory cell function and enhancing profibrogenic cytokine production in an ST2- and macrophage-dependent manner.},

abstract = {GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) is a transcriptional activator highly expressed by the luminal epithelial cells in the breast. Here we did a meta-analysis of the available breast cancer cDNA data sets on a cohort of 305 patients and found that GATA3 was one of the top genes with low expression in invasive carcinomas with poor clinical outcome. To validate its prognostic utility, we did a tissue microarray analysis on a cohort of 139 consecutive invasive carcinomas (n = 417 tissue samples) immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against GATA3. Low GATA3 expression was associated with higher histologic grade (P {\textless}0.001), positive nodes (P = 0.002), larger tumor size (P = 0.03), negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (P {\textless}0.001 for both), and HER2-neu overexpression (P = 0.03). Patients whose tumors expressed low GATA3 had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival when compared with those whose tumors had high GATA3 levels. The hazard ratio of metastasis or recurrence according to the GATA3 status was 0.31 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.13-0.74; P = 0.009). Cox multivariate analysis showed that GATA3 had independent prognostic significance above and beyond conventional variables. Our data suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of GATA3 may be the basis for a new clinically applicable test to predict tumor recurrence early in the progression of breast cancer.},

Method: Acute lung injury model was induced by tail-intravenous injection of oleic acid 0.13 gkg-1 mixed with 0.4{\%} bovine serum albumin, while the drugs or normal saline were injected 30 minutes beforehand. The experiment was made in the Animal Lab and the Pharmacology Lab of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. One hundred and nine healthy Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group (n = 16), model group (re = 18), 30 mg{\textperiodcentered} kg-1 anisodamine group (n = 18) and three safflor yellow (SY) groups: 290 mg{\textperiodcentered} kg-1(re = 18), 170 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 = 20) and 100 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1(n = 19). The animals were sacrificed after 5 hours of oleic acid injection. The lung morphological changes were observed by optical microscopy and electron microscopy, plasma IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 levels were determined by ELISA, lung index, A index and B index were measured. The data were expressed as (x̄ ± s) and analyzed by One-Way ANOVA after normality and homogeneityof-variance tests by SPSS 10.0 software. A P value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results: Compared with normal group[(41.3± 1.9),(14.2±0.6),(2.99± 0.15),(111 ± 22) $\mu${\textperiodcentered}L-1, (250±46) $\mu$g-L-1], the lung index, A index, B index as well as the plasma levels of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6[(56.8 ±4.5), (20.0± 1.8), (4.18±0.30), (143±52) $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}L-1,(302±64) $\mu$g-L-1] remarkably increased in the model group(P {\textless} 0.01 or P {\textless} 0.05), and the lung morphological changes were obvious, such as: alveolar septum widened, edema existing in interstitial spaces, etc. In the three SY groups and the anisodamine group, the lung morphological changes were ameliorated; the three indexes and the levels of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 were significantly reduced (P {\textless} 0.01 or P {\textless}0.05), compared with the model group. Conclusions: SY significantly inhibited oleic acid induced lung inflammation in rats.},

abstract = {Emerging roles are being recognized increasingly for apolipoproteins in the pathogenesis and treatment of lung diseases on the basis of their ability to suppress inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling, and to promote adaptive immunity and host defense. Apolipoproteins, such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), are important components of lipoprotein particles that facilitate the transport of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids between plasma and cells. ApoE- containing lipoprotein particles are internalized into cells by low- density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs), whereas apoA-I can interact with the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) transporter to efflux cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells. ApoE and apoA-I also mediate receptor-independent effects, such as binding to and neutralizing LPS. Both apoE and apoA-I are expressed by lung cells, which allows apoE/LDLR- and apoA-I/ABCA1- dependent pathways to modulate normal lung health and the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, including asthma, acute lung injury, cancer, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Data from human studies and research using experimental murine model systems have shown that both apoE and apoA-I pathways play primarily protective roles in lung biology and respiratory disease. Furthermore, apolipoprotein mimetic peptides, corresponding to the LDLR-binding domain of apoE or the class A amphipathic a-helical structure of apoA-I, have antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects that attenuate the severity of lung disease in murine models. Thus, the development of inhaled apolipoprotein mimetic peptides as a novel treatment paradigm could represent a significant advance for patients with respiratory disease who do not respond to current therapies.},

abstract = {Telomeres are short in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Whether dysfunctional telomeres contribute directly to development of lung fibrosis remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate whether telomere dysfunction in type II AECs, mediated by deletion of the telomere shelterin protein TRF1, leads to pulmonary fibrosis in mice (SPC-Cre TRF1fl/fl mice). Deletion of TRF1 in type II AECs for 2 weeks increased $\gamma$H2AX DNA damage foci, but not histopathologic changes in the lung. Deletion of TRF1 in type II AECs for up to 9 months resulted in short telomeres and lung remodeling characterized by increased numbers of type II AECs, $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin+ mesenchymal cells, collagen deposition, and accumulation of senescence-associated $\beta$-galactosidase+ lung epithelial cells. Deletion of TRF1 in collagen-expressing cells caused pulmonary edema, but not fibrosis. These results demonstrate that prolonged telomere dysfunction in type II AECs, but not collagen-expressing cells, leads to age-dependent lung remodeling and fibrosis. We conclude that telomere dysfunction in type II AECs is sufficient to cause lung fibrosis, and may be a dominant molecular defect causing IPF. SPC-Cre TRF1fl/fl mice will be useful for assessing cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung fibrosis mediated by telomere dysfunction.},

abstract = {Human monocytes are commonly defined and discriminated by the extent of their cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, with associated differences in function and phenotype related to the intensity of expression of these markers. With increasing interest into the function and behaviour of monocytes, it is important to have a clear understanding of how differing strategies of analysis can affect results and how different protocols and population backgrounds can affect this highly morphogenic cell type.Using PBMCs from populations with differing ethnicities and histories of parasite exposure we have characterized monocyte phenotype based on intensity of CD14 and CD16 expression. Using the surface markers HLA-DR, CCR2 and CX3CR1, we compared monocyte phenotype between populations and further assessed changes in monocytes with freezing and thawing of PBMCs.Our results reveal that there is a progression of surface marker expression based on intensity of CD14 or CD16 expression, stressing the importance of careful gating of monocyte subtypes. Freezing and thawing of the PBMCs has no effect generally on the monocytes, although it does lead to a decrease in CD16 and CX3CR1 expression. We show that there are differences in the monocyte populations based on ethnicity and history of exposure to the common parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.This study highlights that blood monocytes consist of a continuous population of cells, within which the dominant phenotype may vary dependent on the background of the study population. Comparing results from monocyte studies therefore needs to be done with great care, as ethnic background of donor population, gating strategy and processing of PBMCs may all have an effect on outcome of monocyte phenotype. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In recent decades there has been a significant shift in our understanding of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and lethal disorder. While initially much of the mechanistic understanding was derived from hypotheses generated from animal models of disease, in recent decades new insights derived from humans with IPF have taken precedence. This is mainly because of the establishment of large collections of IPF lung tissues and patient cohorts, and the emergence of high throughput profiling technologies collectively termed ‘omics' technologies based on their shared suffix. In this review we describe impacts of ‘omics' analyses of human IPF samples on our understanding of the disease. In particular, we discuss the results of genomics and transcriptomics studies, as well as proteomics, epigenomics and metabolomics. We then describe how these findings can be integrated in a modified paradigm of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, that introduces the ‘hallmarks of aging' as a central theme in the IPF lung. This allows resolution of all the disparate cellular and molecular features in IPF, from the central role of epithelial cells, through the dramatic phenotypic alterations observed in fibroblasts and the numerous aberrations that inflammatory cells exhibit. We end with reiterating a call for renewed efforts to collect and analyze carefully characterized human tissues, in ways that would facilitate implementation of novel technologies for high resolution single cell omics profiling.},

We aimed to identify prognostic factors, including multidimensional indices from a significant IPF cohort at the Bristol Interstitial Lung Disease Centre in the UK. Patients diagnosed with IPF between 2007 and 2014 were identified. Longitudinal pulmonary physiology and exercise testing results were collated, with all-cause mortality used as the primary outcome. Factors influencing overall, 12- and 24-month survival were identified using Cox proportional hazards modelling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We found in this real-world cohort of 167 patients, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and initiation of long-term oxygen were independent markers of poor prognosis. Exercise testing results predicted 12-month mortality as well as DLCO, but did not perform as well for overall survival. The Composite Physiological Index was the best performing multidimensional index, but did not outperform DLCO. Our data confirmed that patients who experienced a fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) {\textgreater}10{\%} had significantly worse survival after that point (p=0.024). Our data from longitudinal follow-up in IPF show that DLCO is the best individual prognostic marker, outperforming FVC. Exercise testing is important in predicting early poor outcome.

Using murine models we demonstrate a role for interleukin (IL)-25 in the generation of pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, we identify IL-13 release from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) as sufficient to drive collagen deposition in the lungs of challenged mice and suggest this as a potential mechanism through which IL-25 is acting. Additionally, we demonstrate that in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis there is increased pulmonary expression of IL-25 and also observe a population ILC2 in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. Collectively, we present an innate mechanism for the generation of pulmonary fibrosis, via IL-25 and ILC2, that occurs independently of T-cell-mediated antigen-specific immune responses. These results suggest the potential of therapeutically targeting IL-25 and ILC2 for the treatment of human fibrotic diseases.},

abstract = {Monocytes are short-lived mononuclear phagocytes that circulate in the bloodstream and comprise two main subpopulations that in the mouse are best defined by the Ly6C marker. Intravascular functions of " classical " Ly6C + monocytes and their interactions with other lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes in the circulation remain poorly understood. Rather, these cells are known to efficiently extravasate into tissues. Indeed, Ly6C + monocytes and their descendants have emerged as a third, highly plastic and dynamic cellular system that complements the two classical, tissue-resident mononuclear phagocyte compartments, i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells, on demand. Following recruitment to injured tissue, Ly6C + monocytes respond to local cues and can critically contribute to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory reactions. The second main murine monocyte subset, Ly6C – cells, derive in steady state from Ly6C + monocytes and remain in the vasculature, where the cells act as scavengers. Moreover, a major fraction of Ly6C – monocytes adheres to the capillary endothelium and patrols the vessel wall for surveillance. Given the central role of monocytes in homeostasis and pathology, in-depth study of this cellular compartment can be highly informative on the health state of the organism and provides an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can emerge from certain pathologies, such as sepsis, fat embolism and leptospirosis, in which the levels of unesterified fatty acids are increased in the patient's plasma. ARDS is characterized by edema formation, and edema resolution occurs mainly due to the pneumocyte Na/K-ATPase activity. As previously described, increased oleic acid (OA) plasma concentrations induce lung injury by interfering with sodium transport. The first aim of this study was to develop a radioactivity-free assay to detect Na,K-ATPase activity ex vivo using a model of OA-induced lung injury in mice. We also investigated the relationship between Na/K-ATPase inhibition and OA-induced lung injury using ouabain-induced lung injury as a comparison, because of the well-described effect of ouabain as a Na/K-ATPase inhibitor.METHODS:We developed a Na/K-ATPase assay based on the capture of non-radioactive Rb+ ions by mice lung tissue in the absence or presence of ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase inhibitor. Rb+ incorporation into the lung was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after lung tissue mineralization. Na/K-ATPase activity was considered as the difference between Rb+ incorporation in the absence and in the presence of ouabain. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected for lung injury assessment. For this assessment, cell counting, lipid body enumeration and lipid mediator concentrations were measured. Histological analyses were used to determinate lung pathology. Whole body plethysmographic analysis was performed to assay lung function.RESULTS:The lung Na/K-ATPase activity of mice was completely inhibited by an OA dose of 10mumol, an effect also obtained with 10-3mumol of ouabain, as demonstrated by the decreased Rb+ incorporation in the lungs. The same OA dose induced lung edema and inflammation with cell influx, lipid body formation, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Ouabain also induced lung inflammation, as detected by histological examinations. As far as we know, this is the first time that ouabain-induced lung injury was shown. Both OA and ouabain induced functional lung pathology in mice simultaneously with inhibition of the lung Na/K-ATPase activity.CONCLUSIONS:We developed a new non-radioactive assay to quantified Na/K-ATPase in vivo. OA and ouabain inhibited in vivo Na/K-ATPase activity in the lungs and induced lung injury. Our data reinforce the idea that Na/K-ATPase inhibitors may worsen lung injury in specific pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Lung macrophages have been reported to regulate both progression and remission of bleomycin-induced diffuse PF. However, it remains unclear how macrophages contribute to silica-induced progressive nodular PF and the associated tissue cell responses in vivo. We found that lack of monocyte-derived macrophages results in the formation of diffuse PF after silica instillation. We found that the proportion and the number of monocyte-derived macrophages were persistently higher in silica-induced progressive PF compared with bleomycin-induced PF. Surprisingly, in Ccr2-/-mice, in which monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration is impaired, silica administration induced diffuse PF with loose nodule formation and greater activation of tissue cells. In the diffuse lesions, the distribution of epithelial cells, distribution of myofibroblasts, and architecture of the basement membrane were disrupted. Consistent with the development of diffuse lesions, genes that were differentially expressed in CD45-tissue cells from the lung of wild-type and Ccr2-/-mice were highly enriched in human diffuse, progressive PF. In gene ontology network analyses, many of these genes were associated with tissue remodeling and included genes not previously associated with PF, such as Mmp14, Thbs2, and Fgfr4. Overall, these results indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages prevent transition from nodular to diffuse silica-induced PF, potentially by regulating tissue cell responses.},

abstract = {Diffuse low-grade glioma (DLGG) is a well-differentiated, slow-growing tumour with an inherent tendency to progress to high-grade glioma. The potential roles of genetic alterations in DLGG development have not yet been fully delineated. Therefore, the current study performed an integrated gene expression meta-analysis of eight independent, publicly available microarray datasets including 291 DLGGs and 83 non-glioma (NG) samples to identify gene expression signatures associated with DLGG. Using INMEX, 708 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (385 upregulated and 323 downregulated genes) were identified in DLGG compared to NG. Furthermore, 497 DEGs (222 upregulated and 275 downregulated genes) corresponding to two histological types were identified. Of these, high expression of HIP1R significantly correlated with increased overall survival, whereas high expression of TBXAS1 significantly correlated with decreased overall survival. Additionally, network-based meta-analysis identified FN1 and APP as the key hub genes in DLGG compared with NG. PTPN6 and CUL3 were the key hub genes identified in the astrocytoma relative to the oligodendroglioma. Further immunohistochemical validation revealed that MTHFD2 and SPARC were positively expressed in DLGG, whereas RBP4 was positively expressed in NG. These findings reveal potential molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy in patients with DLGG and provide a rich and novel candidate reservoir for future studies.},

Distinct from the simple M1/M2 dichotomy initially proposed, extensive diversity of macrophage phenotypes have been extensively demonstrated as characteristic features of monocyte-macrophage differentiation, highlighting the difficulty of defining complex profiles by a limited number of genes. Since the description of macrophage activation is currently contentious and confusing, the generation of a simple and reliable framework to categorize major Mϕ phenotypes in the context of complex clinical conditions would be extremely relevant to unravel different roles played by these cells in pathophysiological scenarios. In the current study, we integrated transcriptome data using bioinformatics tools to generate two macrophage molecular signatures. We validated our signatures in in vitro experiments and in clinical samples. More importantly, we were able to attribute prognostic and predictive values to components of our signatures. Our study provides a framework to guide the interrogation of macrophage phenotypes in the context of health and disease. The approach described here could be used to propose new biomarkers for diagnosis in diverse clinical settings including dengue infections, asthma and sepsis resolution.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is caused by alterations in expression of proteins involved in multiple pathways, including matrix deposition, inflammation, injury, and repair. OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless}0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

As a role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been discussed, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be involved in the initiation of a first immune reaction. We analyzed expression and functional relevance of several TLRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. In parallel, we determined the release of C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 by BAL cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 1 and 2, TLR2, TLR6, and TLR9 expression by BAL cells was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and cell surface expression by flow cytometry. Chemokine release was measured in BAL cell culture supernatants by ELISA. We found increased TLR9 mRNA expression in patients with sarcoidosis with chest X-ray type I and II and TLR9 protein expression in BAL cells from patients with chest X-ray type II and III. Stimulation with CpG nucleotides increased CXCL10 release by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis type II significantly compared with control subjects or other patients with sarcoidosis. In contrast, no increase in TNF, IL-12p40, or CXCL8 was detected. Spontaneous release of CXCL10, but not CXCL9 or CXCL11, by cultured BAL cells was also highest in cells from patients with chest X-ray type II. We found a significant association between TLR9 expression and CD4(+) lymphocytes in BAL. Our data demonstrate that TLR9 ligands may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis via induction of CXCL10 release in the alveolar macrophages.},

We show that specific genetic deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages after their recruitment to the lung ameliorated lung fibrosis, whereas tissue-resident alveolar macrophages did not contribute to fibrosis. Using transcriptomic profiling of flow-sorted cells, we found that monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation unfolds continuously over the course of fibrosis and its resolution. During the fibrotic phase, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages differ significantly from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in their expression of profibrotic genes. A population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages persisted in the lung for one year after the resolution of fibrosis, where they became increasingly similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Human homologues of profibrotic genes expressed by mouse monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during fibrosis were up-regulated in human alveolar macrophages from fibrotic compared with normal lungs. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting alveolar macrophage differentiation within the lung may ameliorate fibrosis without the adverse consequences associated with global monocyte or tissue-resident alveolar macrophage depletion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Through basic and translational approaches involving murine models and human genetic epidemiology, we show here the importance of the different inflammasomes in regulating inflammatory responses in mice and humans with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disorder of the lungs and digestive system. While both contributing to pathogen clearance, NLRP3 more than NLRC4 contributes to deleterious inflammatory responses in CF and correlates with defective NLRC4-dependent IL-1Ra production. Disease susceptibility in mice and microbial colonization in humans occurs in conditions of genetic deficiency of NLRC4 or IL-1Ra and can be rescued by administration of the recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra. These results indicate that pathogenic NLRP3 activity in CF could be negatively regulated by IL-1Ra and provide a proof-of-concept evidence that inflammasomes are potential targets to limit the pathological consequences of microbial colonization in CF.},

Recently, there have been many clinical successes using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Despite demonstrated successes in a variety of malignancies, responses only typically occur in a minority of patients in any given histology. Additionally, treatment is associated with inflammatory toxicity and high cost. Therefore, determining which patients would derive clinical benefit from immunotherapy is a compelling clinical question. Although numerous candidate biomarkers have been described, there are currently three FDA-approved assays based on PD-1 ligand expression (PD-L1) that have been clinically validated to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from a single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Because of the complexity of the immune response and tumor biology, it is unlikely that a single biomarker will be sufficient to predict clinical outcomes in response to immune-targeted therapy. Rather, the integration of multiple tumor and immune response parameters, such as protein expression, genomics, and transcriptomics, may be necessary for accurate prediction of clinical benefit. Before a candidate biomarker and/or new technology can be used in a clinical setting, several steps are necessary to demonstrate its clinical validity. Although regulatory guidelines provide general roadmaps for the validation process, their applicability to biomarkers in the cancer immunotherapy field is somewhat limited. Thus, Working Group 1 (WG1) of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Immune Biomarkers Task Force convened to address this need. In this two volume series, we discuss pre-analytical and analytical (Volume I) as well as clinical and regulatory (Volume II) aspects of the validation process as applied to predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. To illustrate the requirements for validation, we discuss examples of biomarker assays that have shown preliminary evidence of an association with clinical benefit from immunotherapeutic interventions. The scope includes only those assays and technologies that have established a certain level of validation for clinical use (fit-for-purpose). Recommendations to meet challenges and strategies to guide the choice of analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays are also provided.},

abstract = {The lung is exposed to a vast array of inhaled antigens, particulate matter, and pollution. Cells present in the airways must therefore be maintained in a generally suppressive phenotype so that excessive responses to nonserious irritants do not occur; these result in bystander damage to lung architecture, influx of immune cells to the airways, and consequent impairment of gas exchange. To this end, the resident cells of the lung, which are predominantly macrophages, are kept in a dampened state. However, on occasion the suppression fails and these macrophages overreact to antigenic challenge, resulting in release of inflammatory mediators, induction of death of lung epithelial cells, deposition of extracellular matrix, and development of immunopathology. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms behind this macrophage-mediated pathology, in the context of a number of inflammatory pulmonary disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal restrictive respiratory disease under the idiopathic lung disease (ILD) class. IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and has more scarring, less inflammation, and poorer prognosis than most other ILD forms. Exacerbation of IPF is rapid, with unpredictable deterio- ration of lung function, and is associated with short-term mortality. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF reports that the incidence of acute exacerbations is between 5{\%}-10{\%}. Limited real-world evidence has been identified in the United States that assesses patterns of hospitalization, exacerbation of IPF, and the associated economic burden. OBJECTIVES: To (a) characterize patients newly diagnosed with IPF and (b) examine incidence rates and costs of all-cause hospitalizations, IPF-related hospitalizations, and exacerbations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with a national com- mercial claims database from calendar years 2006 to 2011. Newly diag- nosed IPF patients were identified with either ≥ 2 claims for idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (IFA) or ≥ 1 claim for IFA and ≥ 1 claim for postinflam- matory pulmonary fibrosis and a lung biopsy or thoracic high-resolution computed tomography within 90 days of the first claim for IFA (index date). IPF-related hospitalizations and possible IPF exacerbations were defined based on diagnoses recorded on event claims. Frequency, incidence rate, duration of events, and associated costs from the third-party payer's per- spective were estimated. RESULTS: Among 1,735 identified IPF patients, 38.6{\%} had at least 1 all-cause hospitalization; 10.8{\%} had IPF-related hospitalizations; 4.6{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to hospitalization; and 72.1{\%} had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to urgent outpatient visits dur- ing the 1-year post-index period. Incident rates for these 4 events were 83 (95{\%} CI = 79-88), 17 (95{\%} CI = 14-19), 7 (95{\%} CI = 6-9), and 277 (95{\%} CI = 269-286) per 100 person-years, respectively. Average costs per event were {\$}13,987 (SD = {\$}41,988), {\$}16,812 (SD = {\$}66,399), {\$}14,731 (SD = {\$}85,468), and {\$}444 (SD = {\$}1,481), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and possible exacerbations among patients with IPF were costly. Appropriate management of IPF needs to be consid- ered to help slow IPF disease progression. J},

As a result of this process of sustained attrition to organs, many diseases that involve fibrosis are often progressive conditions and have a poor long-term prognosis. Inflammation is often a prelude to fibrosis, with innate and adaptive immunity involved in both the initiation and regulation of the fibrotic process. In this review, we will focus on the emerging roles of the newly described innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the generation of fibrotic disease with an examination of the potential interplay between ILC and macrophages and the adaptive immune system.},

Emerging data suggest that in addition, they have important tissue-specific functions that range from clearance of surfactant from the lungs to neuronal pruning and establishment of gut homeostasis. The differentiation and tissue-specific activation of macrophages require precise regulation of gene expression, a process governed by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin structure. We argue that epigenetic regulation of macrophages is determined by lineage- and tissue-specific transcription factors controlled by the built-in programming of myeloid development in combination with signaling from the tissue environment. Perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms of tissue macrophage identity can affect normal macrophage tissue function and contribute to pathologies ranging from obesity and autoimmunity to neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of interleukin (IL)-9, a cytokine active on B and T lymphocytes and associated with bronchial asthma, on the development of lung fibrosis induced by crystalline silica particles. Therefore, we compared the response to silica (1 and 5 mg/animal, intratracheally) in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-9 (Tg5) and their wild-type counterparts (FVB). At 2 and 4 mo after treatment with silica, histologic examination and measurement of lung hydroxyproline content showed that the severity of fibrosis was significantly less important in Tg5 mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-9 in C57BL/6 mice also reduced the amplitude of silica-induced lung fibrosis. The reduction of lung fibrosis by IL-9 was associated with a significant expansion of the B-lymphocyte population, both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the pulmonary parenchyma. In wild-type animals, silica-induced fibrosis correlated with markers of a T helper 2-like response such as upregulation of IL-4 levels in lung tissue and an increased immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/IgG2a ratio in BAL. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the upregulation of IL-4 associated with the development of fibrosis was mainly localized in inflammatory alveolar macrophages. In transgenic mice, the level of IL-4 in lung homogenates was not significantly affected by silica treatment, and a reduced IgG1/IgG2a ratio was observed upon treatment with silica. The levels of interferon-gamma were significantly decreased after silica treatment in both strains. Together, these observations point to an antifibrotic effect of IL-9 in pulmonary fibrosis associated with a limitation of the type 2 polarization which accompanies lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},

abstract = {Background: Some of the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery may be mediated by the gut microbiome. Objectives: To study the effect of bariatric surgery on changes to gut microbiota composition and bacterial pathways, and their relation to metabolic parameters after bariatric surgery. Settings: University hospitals in the United States and Spain. Methods: Microbial diversity and composition by 16 S rRNA sequencing, putative bacterial pathways, and targeted circulating metabolites were studied in 26 individuals with severe obesity, with and without type 2 diabetes, before and at 3, 6, and 12 months after either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Results: Bariatric surgery tended to increase alpha diversity, and significantly altered beta diversity, microbiota composition, and function up to 6 months after surgery, but these changes tend to regress to presurgery levels by 12 months. Twelve of 15 bacterial pathways enriched after surgery also regressed to presurgery levels at 12 months. Network analysis identified groups of bacteria significantly correlated with levels of circulating metabolites over time. There were no differences between study sites, surgery type, or diabetes status in terms of microbial diversity and composition at baseline and after surgery. Conclusions: The association among changes in microbiome with decreased circulating biomarkers of inflammation, increased bile acids, and products of choline metabolism and other bacterial pathways suggest that the microbiome partially mediates improvement of metabolism during the first year after bariatric surgery.},

In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental groups. The large amount of data, multiplicity of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data analysis. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset.},

Intriguingly, they share two ligands, CD80 and CD86, but at present there is no clear model for understanding whether a ligand will promote or inhibit responses. Current perceptions are based around the concept that CD86 is the initial co-stimulatory ligand based on its more abundant and earlier expression pattern; CD80 has a role following antigen-presenting-cell activation. We describe an alternative view in which CD80 is the initial ligand, responsible for maintaining aspects of immune tolerance through interactions with CD152. These inhibitory functions can then be over-ridden by the upregulation of CD86 on dendritic cells as a result of inflammatory stimuli, leading to immune activation.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4{\%} and 83.4+8{\%} in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value {\textgreater} 0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value {\textgreater} 0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value {\textgreater} 0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The ex vivo finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.},

abstract = {Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by an early inflammatory response followed by a late fibroproliferative phase, and by an increase in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) concentrations of bioactive soluble FasL (sFasL). Activation of Fas (CD95) has been associated with the development of lung fibrosis in mice. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms that link Fas activation with the development of fibrosis in the lungs. We treated mice with three daily intratracheal instillations of a Fas-activating monoclonal antibody (Jo2) or a control IgG, and studied the animals at sequential times. Mice treated with Jo2 had increased caspase-3 activation in alveolar wall cells on Days 2, 4, and 7; an inflammatory response peaking on Day 7, and increased total lung collagen on Day 21. Gene expression profiling performed on Days 2, 4, and 7 showed sequential activation of co-regulated profibrotic genes, including marked up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12). Targeted deletion of MMP-12 protected mice from Fas-induced pulmonary fibrosis, even though the inflammatory responses in the lungs were similar to those of wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, the mmp12(-/-) mice showed decreased expression of the profibrotic genes egr1 and cyr61. We conclude that Fas activation in the lungs induces a complex response that includes apoptosis, inflammation, and eventually fibrosis, and that MMP-12 is essential for the fibrotic phenotype. We speculate that MMP-12 activity is required for activation of the profibrotic genes egr1 and cyr61.},

We investigated macrophage function mechanistically in a reversible model of liver injury in which the injury and recovery phases are distinct. Carbon tetrachloride---induced liver fibrosis revealed scar-associated macrophages that persisted throughout recovery. A transgenic mouse (CD11b-DTR) was generated in which macrophages could be selectively depleted. Macrophage depletion when liver fibrosis was advanced resulted in reduced scarring and fewer myofibroblasts. Macrophage depletion during recovery, by contrast, led to a failure of matrix degradation. These data provide the first clear evidence that functionally distinct subpopulations of macrophages exist in the same tissue and that these macrophages play critical roles in both the injury and recovery phases of inflammatory scarring.},

It relies on the capture of secreted native full-length antibodies on the cell surface via binding to an externally immobilized ZZ domain, which tightly binds antibody Fc. It is beneficial for high-throughput screening of yeast-displayed IgG-libraries during antibody discovery and development. In a model experiment, antibody-displaying yeast cells were isolated from a 1:1,000,000 mixture with control cells confirming the maintenance of genotype-phenotype linkage. Antibodies with improved binding characteristics were obtained by affinity maturation using REAL-Select, demonstrating the ability of this system to display antibodies in their native form and to detect subtle changes in affinity by flow cytometry. The biotinylation of the cell surface followed by functionalization with a streptavidin-ZZ fusion protein is an approach that is independent of the genetic background of the antibody-producing host and therefore can be expected to be compatible with other eukaryotic expression hosts such as P. pastoris or mammalian cells.},

Subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from which genomic DNA was isolated. The V3-V5 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified, allowing quantification of bacterial load and identification of communities by 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with IPF had double the burden of bacteria in BAL fluid compared with 44 control subjects. Baseline bacterial burden predicted the rate of decline in lung volume and risk of death and associated independently with the rs35705950 polymorphism of the MUC5B mucin gene, a proven host susceptibility factor for IPF. Sequencing yielded 912,883 high-quality reads from all subjects. We identified Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella spp. to be more abundant in cases than control subjects. Regression analyses indicated that these specific operational taxonomic units as well as bacterial burden associated independently with IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: IPF is characterized by an increased bacterial burden in BAL that predicts decline in lung function and death.

This workflow is directly applicable to current “Gene” type arrays, e.g. the HuGene or MoGene arrays but can easily adapted to similar platforms. The data re–analyzed is a typical clinical microarray data set that compares inflammed and non–inflammed colon tissue in two disease subtypes. We will start from the raw data CEL files, show how to import them into a Bioconductor ExpressionSet, perform quality control and normalization and finally differential gene expression (DE) analysis, followed by some enrichment analysis. As experimental designs can be complex, a self contained introduction to linear models is also part of the workflow.},

CCL2 levels correlated negatively with the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung (D(L,CO)) and arterial oxygen tension. CCR5 expression was significantly reduced in lymphocytes from IPF compared with controls. The CC chemokines investigated are involved in the inflammatory mechanisms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and the results are in agreement with the hypothesis of a downregulation of the T-helper 1 immunological response in this disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF and whether components of this signature may serve as biomarkers for disease presence and progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the concentrations of 49 proteins in the plasma of 74 patients with IPF and in the plasma of 53 control individuals. We identified a combinatorial signature of five proteins-MMP7, MMP1, MMP8, IGFBP1, and TNFRSF1A-that was sufficient to distinguish patients from controls with a sensitivity of 98.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 92.7{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 98.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 89.9{\%}-100{\%}). Increases in MMP1 and MMP7 were also observed in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from IPF patients. MMP7 and MMP1 plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis and distinguished IPF compared to subacute/chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease that may mimic IPF, with a sensitivity of 96.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 81.0{\%}-100{\%}) and specificity of 87.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 72.6{\%}-95.7{\%}). We verified our results in an independent validation cohort composed of patients with IPF, familial pulmonary fibrosis, subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD), as well as with control individuals. MMP7 and MMP1 concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to controls in this cohort. Furthermore, MMP7 concentrations were elevated in patients with subclinical ILD and negatively correlated with percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC{\%}) and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments provide the first evidence for a peripheral blood protein signature in IPF to our knowledge. The two main components of this signature, MMP7 and MMP1, are overexpressed in the lung microenvironment and distinguish IPF from other chronic lung diseases. Additionally, increased MMP7 concentration may be indicative of asymptomatic ILD and reflect disease progression.},

@article{Moore2006,
abstract = {We have previously shown that mice that are genetically deficient in the CCR2 gene (CCR2-/- mice) are protected from fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced lung fibrosis. Protection from fibrosis correlated with impaired recruitment of fibrocytes (bone marrow-derived cells, which share both leukocyte and mesenchymal markers). There are three ligands for CCR2 in the mouse: CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12. CCL2 and CCL12 are both elevated in the lung after FITC injury, but with different kinetics. CCL2 is maximal at Day 1 and absent by Day 7 after FITC. In contrast, CCL12 peaks at Day 3, but remains elevated through Day 21 after FITC. We now demonstrate that while CCR2-/- mice are protected from FITC-induced fibrosis, CCL2-/- mice are not. CCL2-/- mice are able to recruit fibrocytes to FITC-injured airspaces, unlike CCR2-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of CCR2-expressing fibrocytes augments FITC-induced fibrosis in both wild-type and CCR2-/- mice, suggesting that these cells play a pathogenic role in the disease process. Both CCL2 and CCL12 are chemotactic for fibrocytes. However, neutralization of CCL12 in wild-type mice significantly protects from FITC-induced fibrosis, whereas neutralization of CCL2 was less effective. Thus, CCL12 is likely the CCR2 ligand responsible for driving fibroproliferation in the mouse. As murine CCL12 is homologous to human CCL2, we suggest that the pathobiology of murine CCL12 in fibroproliferation may correlate to human CCL2 biology.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are assumed to be among the main agents that cause severe mastitis disease with clinical signs in dairy cattle. Rapid detection of this disease is so important in order to prevent transmission to other cows and helps to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. With the rapid progress in high-throughput technologies, and accumulation of various kinds of ‘-omics' data in public repositories, there is an opportunity to retrieve, integrate, and reanalyze these resources to improve the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases and to provide mechanistic insights into host resistance in an efficient way. Meta-analysis is a relatively inexpensive option with good potential to increase the statistical power and generalizability of single-study analysis. In the current meta-analysis research, six microarray-based studies that investigate the transcriptome profile of mammary gland tissue after induced mastitis by E. coli infection were used. This meta-analysis not only reinforced the findings in individual studies, but also several novel terms including responses to hypoxia, response to drug, anti-apoptosis and positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter enriched by up-regulated genes. Finally, in order to identify the small sets of genes that are sufficiently informative in E. coli mastitis, the differentially expressed gene introduced by meta-analysis were prioritized by using ten different attribute weighting algorithms. Twelve meta-genes were detected by the majority of attribute weighting algorithms (with weight above 0.7) as most informative genes including CXCL8 (IL8), NFKBIZ, HP, ZC3H12A, PDE4B, CASP4, CXCL2, CCL20, GRO1(CXCL1), CFB, S100A9, and S100A8. Interestingly, the results have been demonstrated that all of these genes are the key genes in the immune response, inflammation or mastitis. The Decision tree models efficiently discovered the best combination of the meta-genes as bio-signature and confirmed that some of the top-ranked genes -ZC3H12A, CXCL2, GRO, CFB- as biomarkers for E. coli mastitis (with the accuracy 83{\%} in average). This research properly indicated that by combination of two novel data mining tools, meta-analysis and machine learning, increased power to detect most informative genes that can help to improve the diagnosis and treatment strategies for E. coli associated with mastitis in cattle.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {The systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic disorders collectively represent one of the most serious health problems world-wide causing a large proportion of the total world population mortality. The molecular pathways involved in their pathogenesis are complex and despite intensive investigations have not been fully elucidated. Whereas chronic inflammatory cell infiltration is universally present in fibrotic lesions, the central role of monocytes and macrophages as regulators of inflammation and fibrosis has only recently become apparent. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to the initiation, establishment, or progression of the fibrotic process remain largely unknown. Several monocyte and macrophage subpopulations have been identified, with certain phenotypes promoting inflammation whereas others display profibrotic effects. Given the unmet need for effective treatments for fibroproliferative diseases and the crucial regulatory role of monocyte/macrophage subpopulations in fibrogenesis, the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific monocyte/macrophage subpopulations has become increasingly attractive. We will provide here an overview of the current understanding of the role of monocyte/macrophage phenotype subpopulations in animal models of tissue fibrosis and in various systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, we will discuss recent approaches to the design of effective anti-fibrotic therapeutic interventions by targeting the phenotypic differences identified between the various monocyte and macrophage subpopulations.},

abstract = {Monocytes and macrophages provide the first line of defense against pathogens. They also initiate acquired immunity by processing and presenting antigens and pro- vide the downstream effector functions. Analysis of large gene expression datasets from multiple cells and tissues reveals sets of genes that are co-regulated with the transcription factors that regulate them. In macrophages, the gene clusters include lineage-specific genes, interferon-responsive genes, early inflammatory genes, and genes required for endocytosis and lysosome function. Macrophages enter tissues and alter their function to deal with a wide range of challenges related to development and organogenesis, tissue injury, malignancy, sterile, or pathogenic inflammatory stimuli. These stimuli alter the gene expression to produce “activated macrophages” that are better equipped to eliminate the cause of their influx and to restore homeostasis. Activation or polarization states of macrophages have been classified as “classical” and “alternative” or M1 and M2. These proposed states of cells are not supported by large-scale transcriptomic data, including macrophage-associated signatures from large cancer tissue datasets, where the supposed markers do not correlate with other. Individual macrophage cells differ markedly from each other, and change their func- tions in response to doses and combinations of agonists and time. The most studied macrophage activation response is the transcriptional cascade initiated by the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. This response is reviewed herein. The network topology is conserved across species, but genes within the transcriptional network evolve rapidly and differ between mouse and human. There is also considerable divergence in the sets of target genes between mouse strains, between individuals, and in other species such as pigs. The deluge of complex information related to macrophage activation can be accessed with new analytical tools and new databases that provide access for the non-expert. Keywords:},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with aberrant expression of developmental pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh). As Hh signalling contributes to multiple pro-fibrotic processes, Hh inhibition may represent a therapeutic option for IPF. However, no non-invasive biomarkers are available to monitor lung Hh activity. METHODS We assessed gene and protein expression in IPF and control lung biopsies, mouse lung, fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with sonic hedgehog (SHh), and plasma in IPF patients versus controls, and cancer patients before and after treatment with vismodegib, a Hh inhibitor. RESULTS Lung tissue from IPF patients exhibited significantly greater expression of Hh-related genes versus controls. The gene most significantly upregulated in both IPF lung biopsies and fibroblasts stimulated in vitro with SHh was CXCL14, which encodes a soluble secreted chemokine whose expression is inhibited in vitro by the addition of vismodegib. CXCL14 expression was induced by SHh overexpression in mouse lung. Circulating CXCL14 protein levels were significantly higher in plasma from IPF patients than controls. In cancer patients, circulating CXCL14 levels were significantly reduced upon vismodegib treatment. CONCLUSIONS CXCL14 is a systemic biomarker that could be used to identify IPF patients with increased Hh pathway activity and monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of Hh antagonist therapy in IPF.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the presence of novel subpopulations of pulmonary monocyte-like cells (PMLC) in the human lung; resident PMLC (rPMLC, HLA-DR(+)CD14(++)CD16(+)cells) and inducible PMLC (iPMLC, HLA-DR(+)CD14(++)CD16(-) cells). iPMLC are significantly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following inhalation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have carried out the first functional evaluation of PMLC subpopulations in the inflamed lung, following the isolation of these cells, and other lineages, from BAL fluid using novel and complex protocols. METHODS: iPMLC, rPMLC, alveolar macrophages (AM), neutrophils, and regulatory T cells were quantified in BAL fluid of healthy subjects at 9 hours post-LPS inhalation (n = 15). Cell surface antigen expression by iPMLC, rPMLC and AM and the ability of each lineage to proliferate and to undergo phagocytosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Basal cytokine production by iPMLC compared to AM following their isolation from BAL fluid and the responsiveness of both cell types following in vitro treatment with the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone were assessed. RESULTS: rPMLC have a significantly increased expression of mature macrophage markers and of the proliferation antigen Ki67, compared to iPMLC. Our cytokine data revealed a pro-inflammatory, corticosteroid-resistant phenotype of iPMLC in this model. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasise the presence of functionally distinct subpopulations of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in the human lung in experimental acute lung inflammation.},

abstract = {The heart and blood vessels of a healthy individual contain resident immune cells, the majority of which are macrophages that have seeded these organs early in the development. In the mouse, ≈10{\%} of noncardiomyocytes are macrophages,1,2 and humans may have comparable numbers.1 After myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the heart through the combined effects of massive recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells and local self-renewal.1,3 Likewise, in atherosclerosis, the chronic lipid–driven inflammatory disease that is the underlying cause of myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the vessel wall, again because of recruitment and local proliferation.4 Although many of these insights have been generated in mouse models, compelling evidence from genome-wide association studies have associated innate immunity mediators with myocardial infarction,5 whereas prospective human studies have shown that blood monocyte levels can predict cardiovascular events in patients.6 

During the past decade, multiple studies have challenged and, in some cases, dismantled old assumptions about macrophage origins and functions. Many reviews and opinion pieces7–19—some of them our own20–23—have been written on the subject because the various communities interested in macrophage biology seek to contextualize the findings into a coherent narrative. We now know that, in the steady state, arterial24 and cardiac1,25–27 macrophages are mostly independent of monocytes, but in response to an inflammatory trigger, such as myocardial infarction or high-fat diet, monocyte-derived cells accumulate and differentiate to self-renewing macrophages.3,4,28,29 We also know that macrophage function goes far beyond phagocytosis. Because they reside in nearly every organ, macrophages respond and adapt to their local surroundings, and their noncanonical activities reflect their flexibility.

abstract = {Members of the MMP family function in various processes of innate immunity, particularly in controlling important steps in leukocyte trafficking and activation. MMP28 (epilysin) is a member of this family of proteinases, and we have found that MMP28 is expressed by macrophages and regulates their recruitment to the lung. We hypothesized that MMP28 regulates other key macrophage responses, such as macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these MMP28-dependent changes in macrophage polarization would alter fibrotic responses in the lung. We examined the gene expression changes in WT and Mmp28-/- BMDMs, stimulated with LPS or IL-4/IL-13 to promote M1 and M2 cells, respectively. We also collected macrophages from the lungs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-exposed WT and Mmp28-/- mice to evaluate changes in macrophage polarization. Lastly, we evaluated the macrophage polarization phenotypes during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in WT and Mmp28-/- mice and assessed mice for differences in weight loss and total collagen levels. We found that MMP28 dampens proinflammatory macrophage function and promots M2 programming. In both in vivo models, we found deficits in M2 polarization in Mmp28-/- mice. In bleomycin-induced lung injury, these changes were associated with reduced fibrosis. MMP28 is an important regulator of macrophage polarization, promoting M2 function. Loss of MMP28 results in reduced M2 polarization and protection from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. These findings highlight a novel role for MMP28 in macrophage biology and pulmonary disease.},

abstract = {Importance of chronic fibroproliferative diseases (FDs) including pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular or liver fibrosis is rapidly increasing and they have become a major public health problem. According to some estimates about 45{\%} of all deaths are attributed to FDs in the developed world. Independently of their etiology the common hallmark of FDs is chronic inflammation. Infiltrating immune cells, endothelial, epithelial, and other resident cells of the injured organ release an orchestra of inflammatory mediators, which stimulate the proliferation and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production of myofibroblasts, the effector cells of organ fibrosis. Abnormal amount of ECM disturbs the original organ architecture leading to the decline of function. Although our knowledge is rapidly expanding, we still have neither a diagnostic tool to detect nor a drug to specifically target fibrosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the more comprehensive understanding of the pathomechanism of fibrosis and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the present review we provide an overview of the common key mediators of organ fibrosis highlighting the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine family members (IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26), which recently came into focus as tissue remodeling-related inflammatory cytokines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronically progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Previously, we have demonstrated the selective upregulation of the macrophage-derived chemokine CCL22 and the thymus activation-regulated chemokine CCL17 among chemokines, in a rat model of radiation pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis and preliminarily observed an increase in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid CCL22 levels of IPF patients. METHODS: We examined the expression of CCR4, a specific receptor for CCL22 and CCL17, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cells, as well as the levels of CCL22 and CCL17, to elucidate their pathophysiological roles in pulmonary fibrosis. We also studied their immunohistochemical localization. RESULTS: BAL fluid CCL22 and CCL17 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF than those with collagen vascular diseases and healthy volunteers, and there was a significant correlation between the levels of CCL22 and CCL17 in patients with IPF. CCL22 levels in the BAL fluid did not correlate with the total cell numbers, alveolar lymphocytes, or macrophages in BAL fluid. However, the CCL22 levels significantly correlated with the numbers of CCR4-expressing alveolar macrophages. By immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis, localization of CCL22 and CCR4 to CD68-positive alveolar macrophages as well as that of CCL17 to hyperplastic epithelial cells were shown. Clinically, CCL22 BAL fluid levels inversely correlated with DLco/VA values in IPF patients. CONCLUSION: We speculated that locally overexpressed CCL22 may induce lung dysfunction through recruitment and activation of CCR4-positive alveolar macrophages.},

abstract = {Telomeres are short in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Whether dysfunctional telomeres contribute directly to development of lung fibrosis remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate whether telomere dysfunction in type II AECs, mediated by deletion of the telomere shelterin protein TRF1, leads to pulmonary fibrosis in mice (SPC-Cre TRF1fl/fl mice). Deletion of TRF1 in type II AECs for 2 weeks increased {\$}\gamma{\$}H2AX DNA damage foci, but not histopathologic changes in the lung. Deletion of TRF1 in type II AECs for up to 9 months resulted in short telomeres and lung remodeling characterized by increased numbers of type II AECs, {\$}\alpha{\$}-smooth muscle actin+ mesenchymal cells, collagen deposition, and accumulation of senescence-associated {\$}\beta{\$}-galactosidase+ lung epithelial cells. Deletion of TRF1 in collagen-expressing cells caused pulmonary edema, but not fibrosis. These results demonstrate that prolonged telomere dysfunction in type II AECs, but not collagen-expressing cells, leads to age-dependent lung remodeling and fibrosis. We conclude that telomere dysfunction in type II AECs is sufficient to cause lung fibrosis, and may be a dominant molecular defect causing IPF. SPC-Cre TRF1fl/fl mice will be useful for assessing cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung fibrosis mediated by telomere dysfunction.},

Therefore, the aim was to investigate the role of necroptosis in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) and assess the effect of Nec-1 on lung injury in ARDS. Our results found that RIPK1, RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) were abundantly expressed in rat lung tissues of OA-induced ARDS. Nec-1 pretreatment improved pulmonary function and attenuated lung edema dramatically in OA-induced ARDS rats. Furthermore, Nec-1 reduced RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction and down-regulated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signal pathway, and inhibited inflammatory response by reducing neutrophil infiltration and protein leakage into lung tissue in OA-induced ARDS. Collectively, our study proves the intervention of necroptosis in OA-induced ARDS. Moreover, our findings imply that Nec-1 plays an important role in the treatment of ARDS via inhibiting necroptosis and inflammation.},

Although the GAP model is useful for predicting mortality, survivals have not yet been validated for each GAP score. We aimed to elucidate how prognosis is related to GAP score and GAP stage in IPF patients. Methods: The Korean Interstitial Lung Disease Study Group conducted a national survey to evaluate various characteristics in IPF patients from 2003 to 2007. Patients were diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria of the ATS/ERS. We enrolled 1,685 patients with IPF; 1,262 had undergone DLCO measurement. Patients were stratified based on GAP score (0–7): GAP scoreGroup 0(n= 26), Group 1 (n=150), Group 2 (n=208), Group 3 (n=376), Group 4 (n= 317), Group 5 (n=138), Group 6(n= 39), and Group 7 (n=8). Results: Higher GAP score and GAP stage were associated with a poorer prognosis (p{\textless}0.001, respectively). Survival time in Group 3 was lower than those in Groups 1 and 2 (p=0.043 and p=0.039, respectively), and higher than those in groups 4, 5, and 6 (p=0.043, p=0.032, and p= 0.003, respectively). Gender, age, and DLCO ({\%}) differed significantly between Groups 2 and 3. All four variables in the GAP model differed significantly between Groups 3 and 4. Conclusion: The GAP system showed significant predictive ability for mortality in IPF patients. However, prognosis in IPF patients with a GAP score of 3 were significantly different from those in the other stage I groups and stage II groups of Asian patients.},

abstract = {Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in type 2 immunity. Mice deficient in ST2, a receptor for the latest member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, have impaired type 2 immune responses. We therefore reasoned that IL-33/ST2 signaling may be involved in the differentiation and activation of AAM during airway inflammation. We report here that IL-33 changed the quiescent phenotype of alveolar macrophages toward an AAM phenotype that expressed mannose receptor, IL-4Ralpha, and produced high levels of CCL24 and CCL17 in an IL-13-dependent manner during IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Neutralization of AAM-derived CCL24 led to an amelioration of IL-33-induced eosinophilia in the lungs. Moreover, depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced IL-33-induced airway inflammation. Additionally, the attenuated OVA-induced airway inflammation in ST2(-/-) mice was associated with a decrease in AAM differentiation. In vitro, IL-33 amplified IL-13-induced polarization of alveolar- and bone marrow-derived macrophage toward an AAM phenotype by increasing the expression of arginase I, Ym1, as well as the production of CCL24 and CCL17. IL-13/IL-4Ralpha signaling was crucial for IL-33-driven AAM amplification by inducing the expression of ST2L. Finally, we showed that IL-33 was more abundantly expressed in the lung epithelial cells of asthma patients than those from healthy controls, suggesting that IL-33 may be involved in lung macrophage activation in clinical asthma. Taken together, we demonstrate here that IL-33/ST2 plays a significant role in the amplification of AAM polarization and chemokine production which contribute to innate and Ag-induced airway inflammation.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Differences in the lung microbial community influence idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progression. Whether the lung microbiome influences IPF host defense remains unknown. OBJECTIVES To explore the host immune response and microbial interaction in IPF as they relate to progression-free survival (PFS), fibroblast function, and leukocyte phenotypes. METHODS Paired microarray gene expression data derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data from bronchoalveolar lavage obtained as part of the COMET-IPF (Correlating Outcomes with Biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-Progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) study were used to conduct association pathway analyses. The responsiveness of paired lung fibroblasts to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulation by CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) was integrated into microbiome-gene expression association analyses for a subset of individuals. The relationship between associated pathways and circulating leukocyte phenotypes was explored by flow cytometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Down-regulation of immune response pathways, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, Toll-, and RIG1-like receptor pathways, was associated with worse PFS. Ten of the 11 PFS-associated pathways correlated with microbial diversity and individual genus, with species accumulation curve richness as a hub. Higher species accumulation curve richness was significantly associated with inhibition of NODs and TLRs, whereas increased abundance of Streptococcus correlated with increased NOD-like receptor signaling. In a network analysis, expression of up-regulated signaling pathways was strongly associated with decreased abundance of operational taxonomic unit 1341 (OTU1341; Prevotella) among individuals with fibroblasts responsive to CpG-ODN stimulation. The expression of TLR signaling pathways was also linked to CpG-ODN responsive fibroblasts, OTU1341 (Prevotella), and Shannon index of microbial diversity in a network analysis. Lymphocytes expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 CD8 significantly correlated with OTU1348 (Staphylococcus). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that host-microbiome interactions influence PFS and fibroblast responsiveness.},

abstract = {Introduction: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has prognostic value in various pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We determined the individual prognostic accuracy of distance walked and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT in patients with IPF. We defined a new composite index, the distance-saturation product (DSP), which is the product of distance walked and lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk test. We compared the performance of the DSP to the individual 6MWT parameters in predicting mortality. Methods: We evaluated pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk parameters and the DSP between survivors and non-survivors. The ability of each measure to discriminate outcomes was determined by receiver operator curves. Results: 81 patients (48 survivors, 33 non-survivors) were included. Pulmonary function tests were similar and did not correlate with survival. Desaturation was greater (89.4{\%} versus 83.7{\%}, P {\textless}0.001) and distance walked was lower (406.9 versus 181.3 m, P = 0.005) in non-survivors. The DSP was significantly lower among non-survivors (364.8 versus 153.5 m{\%}, P {\textless}0.001) and predicted mortality more accurately than either individual 6MWT component (P = 0.035 versus desaturation, P = 0.040 versus distance). A DSP {\textless}200 m{\%} was associated with a seven-fold greater risk of 12-month mortality and an 18.0{\%} shorter median survival compared with a DSP{\textgreater}200 m{\%} (P {\textless}0.001). Discussion: Each component of the 6-min walk independently predicted mortality in IPF with greater accuracy than spirometry. However, a composite of both parameters, the DSP, provides slightly greater accuracy and represents a novel measure for assessing survival in patients with IPF.},

As an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9 can be easily programmed to target new sites by altering its guide RNA sequence, and its development as a tool has made sequence-specific gene editing several magnitudes easier. The nuclease-deactivated form of Cas9 further provides a versatile RNA-guided DNA-targeting platform for regulating and imaging the genome, as well as for rewriting the epigenetic status, all in a sequence-specific manner. With all of these advances, we have just begun to explore the possible applications of Cas9 in biomedical research and therapeutics.

In addition, such studies provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant biomarker signatures. We designed a strategy for microarray analysis that is based on the identification of transcriptional modules formed by genes coordinately expressed in multiple disease data sets. Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data. These transcriptional modules were used as a basis for the selection of biomarkers and the development of a multivariate transcriptional indicator of disease progression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oleic acid has been used to induce acute lung injury (ALI) in animals. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the blood level of oleic acid was increased. The mechanism and therapeutic regimen of ARDS and oleic acid-induced ALI remain undefined. In the present study, we investigated the oleic acid-induced changes in lung variables for the measure of ALI, inflammatory mediators, and neutrophil-derived substances. We evaluated the effects of pretreatment and posttreatment with propofol. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g. INTERVENTIONS: We employed a conscious and unrestrained rat model. Oleic acid at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered intravenously. Propofol (30 mg/kg) was given by intravenous infusion (6 mg/kg/min for 5 mins) 30 mins before (pretreatment) and 30 mins after (posttreatment) oleic acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We monitored the arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood gas. The lung weight changes, exhaled nitric oxide, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and Evans blue content in lung tissue were determined. The plasma nitrate/nitrite, methylguanidine, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10), neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase) were detected. Histopathological examination of the lung was performed. Oleic acid caused systemic hypotension and severe ALI as evidenced by the increases in the extent of ALI, impairment of pulmonary functions (blood gas variables), and lung pathology. In addition, oleic acid significantly increased inflammatory mediators and neutrophil-derived factors but depressed Na+-K+-ATPase. The inducible nitric oxide synthase was up-regulated. Pre- or posttreatment with propofol was capable of reversing the oleic acid-induced changes and attenuating the extent of ALI. CONCLUSIONS: Oleic acid resulted in sepsis-like responses including ALI, inflammatory reaction, and increased neutrophil-derived factors. It depressed the Na+-K+-ATPase activity but up-regulated inducible nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with propofol abrogated or reversed the oleic acid-induced changes.},

TaqMan is a registered trademark of Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. We observed high correlation between quantitative gene expression values and microarray platform results and found few discordant measurements among all platforms. The main cause of variability was differences in probe sequence and thus target location. A second source of variability was the limited and variable sensitivity of the different microarray platforms for detecting weakly expressed genes, which affected interplatform and intersite reproducibility of differentially expressed genes. From this analysis, we conclude that the MAQC microarray data set has been validated by alternative quantitative gene expression platforms thus supporting the use of microarray platforms for the quantitative characterization of gene expression.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

abstract = {Innate immune cells are complex systems that can be simultaneously activated in a variety of ways. Common methods currently used to estimate the response of innate immune cells to stimuli are usually biased toward a single mode of activation. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of designing an assay based on unbiased proteome analysis that would be capable of predicting the complex response of the innate immune system to various challenges. Monocytes were used as representative cells of the innate immune system. The underlying hypothesis was that their proteome response to different activating molecules would reflect the immunogenicity of these molecules. To identify the main modes of response, we treated the human monocytic THP-1 cell line with nine different stimuli. Differentiation and activation were determined to be the two major modes of monocyte response, with PMA causing the strongest differentiation and Pam3CSK4 causing the strongest proinflammatory activation. The established assay was applied to characterize the monocyte response to epidermal growth factor peptide containing isoaspartate, which induced differentiation but not proinflammatory activation. Because of its versatility, robustness, and specificity, this new assay is likely to find a niche among the more established immunological methods. {\textcopyright}2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering algorithms are widely used in the analysis of microarray data. In clinical studies, they are often applied to find groups of co-regulated genes. Clustering, however, can also stratify patients by similarity of their gene expression profiles, thereby defining novel disease entities based on molecular characteristics. Several distance-based cluster algorithms have been suggested, but little attention has been given to the distance measure between patients. Even with the Euclidean metric, including and excluding genes from the analysis leads to different distances between the same objects, and consequently different clustering results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We describe a new clustering algorithm, in which gene selection is used to derive biologically meaningful clusterings of samples by combining expression profiles and functional annotation data. According to gene annotations, candidate gene sets with specific functional characterizations are generated. Each set defines a different distance measure between patients, leading to different clusterings. These clusterings are filtered using a resampling-based significance measure.

abstract = {Syphilis has several clinical manifestations, making laboratory testing a very important aspect of diagnosis. In North America, many unsuspected cases are discovered by laboratory testing. The etiological agent, Treponema pallidum, cannot be cultured, and there is no single optimal alternative test. Serological testing is the most frequently used approach in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. The present paper discusses the various serological and alternative tests currently available along with their limitations, and relates their results to the likely corresponding clinical stage of the disease. The need to use multiple tests is discussed, and the importance of quality control is noted. The complexity of syphilis serology means that the services of reference laboratories and clinical experts are often needed.},

abstract = {Microarray-based expression profiling experiments typically use either a one-color or a two-color design to measure mRNA abundance. The validity of each approach has been amply demonstrated. Here we provide a simultaneous comparison of results from one- and two-color labeling designs, using two independent RNA samples from the Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) project, tested on each of three different microarray platforms. The data were evaluated in terms of reproducibility, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy to determine if the two approaches provide comparable results. For each of the three microarray platforms tested, the results show good agreement with high correlation coefficients and high concordance of differentially expressed gene lists within each platform. Cumulatively, these comparisons indicate that data quality is essentially equivalent between the one- and two-color approaches and strongly suggest that this variable need not be a primary factor in decisions regarding experimental microarray design.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The initial next-generation sequencing technologies produced reads of 25 or 36 bp, and only from a single-end of the library sequence. Currently, it is possible to reliably produce 300 bp paired-end sequences for RNA expression analysis. While read lengths have consistently increased, people have assumed that longer reads are more informative and that paired-end reads produce better results than single-end reads. We used paired-end 101 bp reads and trimmed them to simulate different read lengths, and also separated the pairs to produce single-end reads. For each read length and paired status, we evaluated differential expression levels between two standard samples and compared the results to those obtained by qPCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that, with the exception of 25 bp reads, there is little difference for the detection of differential expression regardless of the read length. Once single-end reads are at a length of 50 bp, the results do not change substantially for any level up to, and including, 100 bp paired-end. However, splice junction detection significantly improves as the read length increases with 100 bp paired-end showing the best performance. We performed the same analysis on two ENCODE samples and found consistent results confirming that our conclusions have broad application.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A researcher could save substantial resources by using 50 bp single-end reads for differential expression analysis instead of using longer reads. However, splicing detection is unquestionably improved by paired-end and longer reads. Therefore, an appropriate read length should be used based on the final goal of the study.},

abstract = {Clear identification of specific cell populations by flow cytometry is important to understand functional roles. A well-defined flow cytometry panel for myeloid cells in human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a flow cytometry-based panel for human BAL and lung tissue. We obtained and performed flow cytometry/sorting on human BAL cells and lung tissue. Confocal images were obtained from lung tissue using antibodies for cluster of differentiation (CD)206, CD169, and E cadherin. We defined a multicolor flow panel for human BAL and lung tissue that identifies major leukocyte populations. These include macrophage (CD206(+)) subsets and other CD206(-) leukocytes. The CD206(-) cells include: (1) three monocyte (CD14(+)) subsets, (2) CD11c(+) dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(+), HLA-DR(+)), (3) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD14(-), CD11c(-), HLA-DR(+), CD123(+)), and (4) other granulocytes (neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils). Using this panel on human lung tissue, we defined two populations of pulmonary macrophages: CD169(+) and CD169(-) macrophages. In lung tissue, CD169(-) macrophages were a prominent cell type. Using confocal microscopy, CD169(+) macrophages were located in the alveolar space/airway, defining them as alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CD169(-) macrophages were associated with airway/alveolar epithelium, consistent with interstitial-associated macrophages. We defined a flow cytometry panel in human BAL and lung tissue that allows identification of multiple immune cell types and delineates alveolar from interstitial-associated macrophages. This study has important implications for defining myeloid cells in human lung samples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are chronic inflammatory disorders leading to pulmonary fibrosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) promotes collagen synthesis and deletion of the MCP-1 receptor CCR2 protects from pulmonary fibrosis in ILD mouse models. We hypothesized that pulmonary MCP-1 and CCR2+ T cells accumulate in pediatric ILD and are related to disease severity. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained from 25 children with ILD and 10 healthy children. Levels of pulmonary MCP-1 and Th1/Th2-associated cytokines were quantified at the protein and the mRNA levels. Pulmonary CCR2+, CCR4+, CCR3+, CCR5+ and CXCR3+ T cells were quantified by flow-cytometry. RESULTS: CCR2+ T cells and MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated in children with ILD and correlated with forced vital capacity, total lung capacity and ILD disease severity scores. Children with lung fibrosis had significantly higher MCP-1 levels and CCR2+ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared to non-fibrotic children. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that pulmonary CCR2+ T cells and MCP-1 contribute to the pathogenesis of pediatric ILD and might provide a novel target for therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages are key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. After tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically.},

Although gene co-expression networks typically do not provide information about causality, emerging methods for differential co-expression analysis are enabling the identification of regulatory genes underlying various phenotypes. Here, we introduce and guide researchers through a (differential) co-expression analysis.

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of identifying differentially expressed groups of genes from a microarray experiment. The groups of genes are ex-ternally defined, for example, sets of gene pathways derived from biological databases. Our starting point is the interesting Gene Set Enrichment Analy-sis (GSEA) procedure of Subramanian et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 15545–15550]. We study the problem in some generality and propose two potential improvements to GSEA: the maxmean statistic for summarizing gene-sets, and restandardization for more accurate inferences. We discuss a variety of examples and extensions, including the use of gene-set scores for class predictions. We also describe a new R language package GSA that im-plements our ideas. 1. Introduction. We discuss the problem of identifying differentially ex-pressed groups of genes from a set of microarray experiments. In the usual situation we have N genes measured on n microarrays, under two different ex-perimental conditions, such as control and treatment. The number of genes N is usually large, say, at least a few thousand, while the number samples n is smaller, say, a hundred or fewer. This problem is an example of multiple hypothesis testing with a large number of tests, one that often arises in genomic and proteomic ap-plications, and also in signal processing. We focus mostly on the gene expression problem, but our proposed methods are more widely applicable. Most approaches start by computing a two-sample t-statistic z j for each gene. Genes having t-statistics larger than a pre-defined cutoff (in absolute value) are declared significant, and then the family-wise error rate or false discovery rate of the resulting gene list is assessed by comparing the tail area from a null distribution of the statistic. This null distribution is derived from data permutations, or from asymptotic theory. In an interesting and useful paper, Subramanian et al. (2005) proposed a method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for assessing the significance of pre-defined gene-sets, rather than individual genes. The gene-sets can be derived from different sources, for example, the sets of genes representing biological pathways},

Given two networks, representing different types of gene interactions, we construct a map of linked modules, where modules are genes strongly connected in the first network and links represent strong inter-module connections in the second. We develop novel algorithms that considerably outperform prior art on simulated and real data from three distinct domains. First, by analyzing protein-protein interactions and negative genetic interactions in yeast, we discover epistatic relations among protein complexes. Second, we analyze protein-protein interactions and DNA damage-specific positive genetic interactions in yeast and reveal functional rewiring among protein complexes, suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response. Finally, using transcriptomes of non-small-cell lung cancer patients, we analyze networks of global co-expression and disease-dependent differential co-expression and identify a sharp drop in correlation between two modules of immune activation processes, with possible microRNA control. Our study demonstrates that module maps are a powerful tool for deeper analysis of heterogeneous high-throughput omic data.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and variable clinical course. Although matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is emerging as an important IPF biomarker, reproducibility across studies is unclear. We aimed to determine whether a previously reported prognostic threshold for MMP-7 was predictive of mortality in an independent cohort of IPF patients. METHODS MMP-7 concentrations obtained from heparinized plasma samples were determined by ELISA in 97 patients with IPF and 41 healthy controls. The association of the previously published heparin plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL with all-cause mortality or transplant-free survival (TFS) was determined, either as an independent biomarker or as part of the modified personal clinical and molecular mortality index (m-PCMI). RESULTS MMP-7 plasma concentrations were significantly higher in IPF patients compared to healthy controls (14.40 ± 6.55 ng/mL vs 6.03 ± 2.51 ng/mL, P {\textless}0.001). The plasma MMP-7 threshold of 12.1 ng/mL was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality and TFS (unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) = 25.85 and 15.49, 95{\%} CI: 10.91-61.23 and 5.41-44.34, respectively, P {\textless}0.001). MMP-7 concentrations, split by 12.1 ng/mL, were significantly (P {\textless}0.05) predictive of mortality and TFS after adjusting for age, gender, smoking and baseline pulmonary function parameters, in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. MMP-7 concentrations were negatively correlated with diffusing lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO ) (r = -0.21, P = 0.02), and positively with a mortality risk scoring system (GAP) that combines age, gender, forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO (r = 0.32, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This study confirms that MMP-7 concentrations could be used to accurately predict outcomes across cohorts and centres, when similar collection protocols are applied.},

In addition, such studies provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant biomarker signatures. We designed a strategy for microarray analysis that is based on the identification of transcriptional modules formed by genes coordinately expressed in multiple disease data sets. Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data. These transcriptional modules were used as a basis for the selection of biomarkers and the development of a multivariate transcriptional indicator of disease progression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Therefore, the aim was to investigate the role of necroptosis in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) and assess the effect of Nec-1 on lung injury in ARDS. Our results found that RIPK1, RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) were abundantly expressed in rat lung tissues of OA-induced ARDS. Nec-1 pretreatment improved pulmonary function and attenuated lung edema dramatically in OA-induced ARDS rats. Furthermore, Nec-1 reduced RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction and down-regulated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signal pathway, and inhibited inflammatory response by reducing neutrophil infiltration and protein leakage into lung tissue in OA-induced ARDS. Collectively, our study proves the intervention of necroptosis in OA-induced ARDS. Moreover, our findings imply that Nec-1 plays an important role in the treatment of ARDS via inhibiting necroptosis and inflammation.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by progressive decline in lung function, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Current concepts of the pathogenesis of IPF primarily center on dysregulated epithelial cell repair and altered epithelial-mesenchymal communication and extracellular matrix deposition following chronic exposure to cigarette smoke or environmental toxins. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed towards the role of the intercellular junctional complex in determining the specific properties of epithelia in pulmonary diseases. Additionally, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that specific genetic variants predictive of epithelial cell dysfunction may confer susceptibility to the development of sporadic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A number of genetic disorders linked to pulmonary fibrosis and familial interstitial pneumonias are associated with loss of epithelial integrity. However, the potential links between extra-pulmonary clinical syndromes associated with defects in epithelial cells and the development of pulmonary fibrosis are not well understood. Here, we report a case of hereditary muco-epithelial dysplasia that presented with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema on high-resolution computed tomography. This case illustrates a more generalizable concept of epithelial disintegrity in the development of fibrotic lung diseases, which is explored in greater detail in this review article.},

Proinflammatory cyto- kines, pathogen products, and injurious mechanical ventilation are important contributors of excessive inflammatory responses in the lung. In the present study, we used cDNA microarrays to define the gene expression patterns of A549 cells (an AEC line) in the early stages of three models of pulmonary parenchymal cell activation: cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF?) (20 ng/ml), lipopolysac- charide (LPS, 1 ?g/ml), or cyclic stretch (20{\%} elongation) for either 1 h or 4 h. Differential gene expression profiles were determined by gene array analysis. TNF? induced an inflammatory response pattern, including induction of genes for chemokines, inflammatory mediators, and cell surface membrane proteins. TNF? also increased genes related to pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, signal transduction pro- teins, and transcriptional factors. TNF? further induced a group of genes that may form a negative feedback loop to silence the NF?B pathway. Stimulation of AECs with mechanical stretch changed cell morphology and activated Src protein tyrosine kinase. The combina- tion of TNF? plus stretch enhanced or attenuated expression of multiple genes. LPS decreased microfilament polymerization but had less impact on NF?B translocation and gene expression.

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade all of the extracellular matrix components of the intersititium and may play a role in abnormal alveolar permeability, which is a feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The aims of the present study were to evaluate MMP protein levels in patients with IPF and determine any relationship to treatment and markers of permeability. In total, 20 patients with IPF and eight normal controls underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. MMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were related to clinical outcome and protein permeability index. MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9 were elevated in IPF lavage fluid and levels remained high despite treatment. Levels of MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9, VEGF and protein permeability index were higher in those who died early during follow-up. VEGF, and MMP-8 and -9 levels were higher in those with a rapidly declining lung function over 1 yr. Levels of MMP-3, -7, -8 and -9 correlated with an increased permeability index. Matrix metalloproteinase levels were elevated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and were not modulated by current standard treatment. Matrix metalloproteinase production through an interaction with the known vascular permogen, vascular endothelial growth factor, was potentially associated with abnormal capillary permeability and may have potentiated the neo-angiogenesis seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The changes were greatest in those who died or progressed during follow-up, suggesting that drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor or matrix metalloproteinase activity warrant assessment as novel therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering algorithms are widely used in the analysis of microarray data. In clinical studies, they are often applied to find groups of co-regulated genes. Clustering, however, can also stratify patients by similarity of their gene expression profiles, thereby defining novel disease entities based on molecular characteristics. Several distance-based cluster algorithms have been suggested, but little attention has been given to the distance measure between patients. Even with the Euclidean metric, including and excluding genes from the analysis leads to different distances between the same objects, and consequently different clustering results.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: We describe a new clustering algorithm, in which gene selection is used to derive biologically meaningful clusterings of samples by combining expression profiles and functional annotation data. According to gene annotations, candidate gene sets with specific functional characterizations are generated. Each set defines a different distance measure between patients, leading to different clusterings. These clusterings are filtered using a resampling-based significance measure. Significant clusterings are reported together with the underlying gene sets and their functional definition.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: Our method reports clusterings defined by biologically focused sets of genes. In annotation-driven clusterings, we have recovered clinically relevant patient subgroups through biologically plausible sets of genes as well as new subgroupings. We conjecture that our method has the potential to reveal so far unknown, clinically relevant classes of patients in an unsupervised manner.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nAVAILABILITY: We provide the R package adSplit as part of Bioconductor release 1.9 and on http://compdiag.molgen.mpg.de/software.},

abstract = {Organ fibrosis, the result of exaggerated, persistent, and often irreversible accumulation of extracellular matrix, complicates numerous diseases in all organs and tissues and has particularly serious consequences in the lungs. Abnormally accumulating scar tissue both replaces normally functioning parenchyma and distorts the architecture of unaffected tissue. In the lungs, the fibrotic process often leads to rapid and severe abnormalities in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange properties. There is no confirmed cure, and better therapies are required for treating fibrosis. The development of therapeutic strategies compels a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis, which are diverse, complex, and redundant. Epithelial injury, oxidative stress, coagulation disturbances, and inflammation are engaged in a complex interplay leading to augmented transformation of several cell types into myofibroblasts and prolonged survival of these extracellular matrix-producing cells. Cytokines are centrally engaged in the homeostatic and pathophysiologic regulation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it appears that identical cytokines are utilized by inflammation, profibrotic mechanisms, and the fibrotic process itself, suggesting that specific targeting or utilization of these cytokines holds therapeutic promise. In this article, we review the wealth of recent knowledge on major cytokines involved in the fibrotic process.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with chronic diseases such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe asthma. Because of constant exposure to this fungus, it is critical for the host to exercise an immediate and decisive immune response to clear fungal spores to ward off disease. In this study, we observed that rapidly after infection by A. fumigatus, alveolar macrophages predominantly express Arginase 1 (Arg1), a key marker of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). The macrophages were also found to express Ym1 and CD206 that are also expressed by AAMs but not NOS2, which is expressed by classically activated macrophages. The expression of Arg1 was reduced in the absence of the known signaling axis, IL-4Ralpha/STAT6, for AAM development. While both Dectin-1 and TLR expressed on the cell surface have been shown to sense A. fumigatus, fungus-induced Arg1 expression in CD11c(+) alveolar macrophages was not dependent on either Dectin-1 or the adaptor MyD88 that mediates intracellular signaling by most TLRs. Alveolar macrophages from WT mice efficiently phagocytosed fungal conidia, but those from mice deficient in Dectin-1 showed impaired fungal uptake. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate-filled liposomes increased fungal burden in infected mice. Collectively, our studies suggest that alveolar macrophages, which predominantly acquire an AAM phenotype following A. fumigatus infection, have a protective role in defense against this fungus.},

abstract = {Many human lung cancer cell lines express apolipoprotein E (ApoE), especially cells derived from malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the influence of ApoE expression on lung cancer. In lung cancer tissues, ApoE expression was more frequently found in malignant pleural effusions (MPE)-associated lung adenocarcinoma than in lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma without MPE (P{\textless}0.05), indicating that ApoE is associated with the pathogenesis of MPE in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Next, we examined the roles of ApoE in an MPE-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line that endogenously over-expresses ApoE, PC14PE6/AS2 (AS2). In that experiment we inhibited ApoE expression by transfection of a plasmid carrying ApoE siRNAs into AS2 cells to generate AS-S2 and AS-S3 cells. Compared to vector-control cells and parental AS2 cells, AS2-S2 and AS2-S3 cells grew slower (P{\textless}0.05), were more sensitive to cisplatin, and had significantly impaired cellular migration (P{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, over-expression of ApoE was independently associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients who had MPE at the time of diagnosis (P{\textless}0.001). Conclusively, ApoE over-expression promotes cancer proliferation and migration and contributes to an aggressive clinical course in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and MPE. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Shalek2013,
abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

abstract = {During inflammation, leukocytes influx into lung compartments and interact with extracellular matrix (ECM). Two ECM components, versican and hyaluronan, increase in a range of lung diseases. The interaction of leukocytes with these ECM components controls leukocyte retention and accumulation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and activation as part of the inflammatory phase of lung disease. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic children co-cultured with human lung fibroblasts generate an ECM that is adherent for monocytes/macrophages. Macrophages are present in both early and late lung inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10) is induced in alveolar macrophages with injury and infection and modulates macrophage phenotype and their ability to degrade collagenous ECM components. Collectively, studies outlined in this review highlight the importance of specific ECM components in the regulation of inflammatory events in lung disease. The widespread involvement of these ECM components in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation make them attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

METHODS: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize all available evidence pertinent to our questions. The evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied, and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists. RESULTS: After considering the confidence in effect estimates, the importance of outcomes studied, desirable and undesirable consequences of treatment, cost, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention, and implications to health equity, recommendations were made for or against specific treatment interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations in favor of or against treatment interventions for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

abstract = {Nitrogen mustard (NM) is an alkylating agent known to cause extensive pulmonary injury progressing to fibrosis. This is accompanied by a persistent macrophage inflammatory response. In these studies we characterized the phenotype of macrophages accumulating in the lung over time following NM exposure. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in an increase in CD11b+ macrophages in histologic sections. These cells consisted of iNOS+ proinflammatory M1 macrophages, and CD68+, CD163+, CD206+, YM-1+ and ARG-II+ antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Whereas M1 macrophages were prominent 1-3 d post NM, M2 macrophages were most notable at 28 d. At this time, they were enlarged and vacuolated, consistent with a profibrotic phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated lung macrophages identified three phenotypically distinct subpopulations: mature CD11b-CD43- and CD68+ resident macrophages, which decreased in numbers after NM, and two infiltrating (CD11b+) macrophage subsets: immature CD43+ M1 macrophages and mature CD43- M2 macrophages, which sequentially increased. Time related increases in M1 (iNOS, IL-12alpha, COX-2, TNFalpha, MMP-9, MMP-10) and M2 (IL-10, PTX-2, CTGF, ApoE) genes, as well as chemokines/chemokine receptors associated with trafficking of M1 (CCR2, CCR5, CCL2, CCL5) and M2 (CX3CR1, fractalkine) macrophages to sites of injury, were also noted in macrophages isolated from the lung after NM. The appearance of M1 and M2 macrophages in the lung correlated with NM-induced acute lung injury and the development of fibrosis suggesting a potential role of these macrophage subpopulations in the pathogenic response to NM.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abundant collagen production and accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) in the lower respiratory tract. Mechanisms as to how alveolar macrophages are activated by collagen breakdown products are unknown. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 37 healthy donors (HD). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in the presence of collagen type I, III, IV and V monomers w/wo a neutralizing antibody against scavenger receptor I class A (CD204). Culture supernatants were assayed for the M2 markers CCL18, CCL2, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) by ELISA. Furthermore, expression of phospho-Akt was measured using ELISA and expression of CD204 by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stimulation with collagen type I and III monomers significantly up-regulated CCL18, IL-1ra production of alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CD204 were up-regulated by collagen type I exposure. In addition, collagen type I stimulation increased pospho-Akt expression. Collagen type I effects were abrogated by neutralizing antiCD204 and a non-selective Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Spontaneous CD204 expression of alveolar macrophages was significantly increased in patients with IPF. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that monomeric collagen type I via CD204 induces phospho-Akt expression shifting alveolar macrophages to the profibrotic M2 type. Innate immune responses induced by collagen monomers might perpetuate pulmonary fibrosis.},

Moreover, differentiated monocytes presented with profound transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional differences.

abstract = {Inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages are key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. After tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically.},

Here we review three of the most widely used and comprehensive systems, the statistical analysis tools written in R through the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org), the Java-based TM4 software system available from The Institute for Genomic Research (http://www.tigr.org/software), and BASE, the Web-based system developed at Lund University (http://base.thep.lu.se).},

R is now widely used in academic research, education, and industry. It is constantly growing, with new versions of the core software released regularly and more than 10,000 packages available. It is difficult for the documentation to keep pace with the expansion of the software, and this vital book series provides a forum for the publication of books covering many aspects of the development and application of R. The scope of the series is wide, covering three main threads: • Applications of R to specific disciplines such as biology, epidemiology, genetics, engineering, finance, and the social sciences. • Using R for the study of topics of statistical methodology, such as linear and mixed modeling, time series, Bayesian methods, and missing data. • The development of R, including programming, building packages, and graphics. The books will appeal to programmers and developers of R software, as well as applied statisticians and data analysts in many fields. The books will feature detailed worked examples and R code fully integrated into the text, ensuring their usefulness to researchers, practitioners and students.},

abstract = {The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

abstract = {Both interferon-gamma-producing type 1 T helper (Th1)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells have been proposed to be involved in anti-fungal host defence. Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages are a heterogeneous population of mononuclear phagocytes that are involved in antigen processing and presentation to initiate and regulate immune responses to pathogens, vaccines, tumor, and tolerance to self. In addition to their afferent sentinel function, DCs and macrophages are also critical as effectors and coordinators of inflammation and homeostasis in peripheral tissues. Harnessing DCs and macrophages for therapeutic purposes has major implications for infectious disease, vaccination, transplantation, tolerance induction, inflammation, and cancer immunotherapy. There has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of the developmental origin and function of the cellular constituents of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Significant progress has been made in tandem in both human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte biology. This progress has been accelerated by comparative biology analysis between mouse and human, which has proved to be an exceptionally fruitful strategy to harmonize findings across species. Such analyses have provided unexpected insights and facilitated productive reciprocal and iterative processes to inform our understanding of human and mouse mononuclear phagocytes. In this review, we discuss the strategies, power, and utility of comparative biology approaches to integrate recent advances in human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte biology and its potential to drive forward clinical translation of this knowledge. We also present a functional framework on the parallel organization of human and mouse mononuclear phagocyte networks.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {? 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.Macrophages are dynamic cells that mature under the influence of signals from the local microenvironment into either classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated macrophages with specific functional and phenotypic properties. Although the phenotypic identification of M1 and M2 macrophages is well established in mice, this is less clear for human macrophages. In addition, the persistence and reversibility of polarized human phenotypes is not well established. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into uncommitted macrophages (M0) and then polarized to M1 and M2 phenotypes using LPS/IFN-g and IL-4/IL-13, respectively. M1 and M2 were identified as CD641CD801 and CD11b1CD2091, respectively, by flow cytometry. Polarized M1 cells secreted IP-10, IFN-g, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-1b, and RANTES, whereas M2 cells secreted IL-13, CCL17, and CCL18. Functionally, M2 cells were highly endocytic. In cytokine-deficient medium, the polarized macrophages reverted back to the M0 state within 12 days. If previously polarized macrophages were given the alternative polarizing stimulus after 6 days of resting in cytokine-deficient medium, a switch in polarization was seen (i.e., M1 macrophages switched to M2 and expressed CD11b1CD2091 and vice versa). In summary, we report phenotypic identification of human M1 and M2 macrophages, their functional characteristics, and their ability to be reprogrammed given the appropriate stimuli.},

Recent studies suggest that the invasion success of many species might depend more heavily on their ability to respond to natural selection than on broad physiological tolerance or plasticity. Thus, these studies stress the importance of genetic architecture, selection upon which could result in evolutionary adaptations and possibly speciation. For instance, epistatic interactions and the action of a few genes could facilitate invasion success. These findings emphasize the utility of genomic approaches for determining invasion mechanisms, through analysis of gene expression, gene interactions, and genomic rearrangements that are associated with invasion events.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors and the beta-glucan receptor, dectin-1, mediate macrophage inflammatory responses to Aspergillus fumigatus through MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms; however, pulmonary inflammatory responses in MyD88-deficient mice challenged with A. fumigatus are poorly defined. The role of MyD88 signaling in early pulmonary inflammation and fungal clearance was evaluated in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and MyD88-deficient (MyD88-/-) mice. Early ({\textless}48 h) after infection, MyD88-/- mice had higher fungal burdens than those of WT mice, although fungal burdens rapidly declined ({\textgreater}72 h) in both. MyD88-/- mice had less consolidated inflammation, with fewer NK cells, in lung tissue early (24 h) after infection than did WT mice. At the latter time point, MyD88-/- mouse lungs were characterized by a large amount of necrotic cellular debris and fibrin, while WT lungs had organized inflammation. Although there were equivalent numbers of macrophages in WT and MyD88-/- mouse lung tissues, MyD88-/- cells demonstrated delayed uptake of green fluorescent protein-expressing A. fumigatus (GFP-Af293); histologically, MyD88-/- mouse lungs had more hyphal invasion of terminal airways and vessels, the appearance of bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis, and necrotizing vasculitis. MyD88-/- lung homogenates contained comparatively decreased amounts of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, KC, and gamma interferon and paradoxically increased amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha. These data indicate that the MyD88-dependent pathway mediates acute pulmonary fungal clearance, inflammation, and tissue injury very early after infection. Resolution of abnormalities within a 3-day window demonstrates the importance of redundant signaling pathways in mediating pulmonary inflammatory responses to fungi.},

In-vestigating the function of the SCN has often fo-cused on the identification of rhythmically expressed genes. However, not all genes critical for SCN func-tion are rhythmically expressed. An alternative strat-egy is to characterize those genes that are selec-tively enriched in the SCN. Here, we examined the transcriptome of the SCN and whole brain (WB) of mice using meta-analysis of publicly deposited data across a range of microarray platforms and RNA-Seq data. A total of 79 microarrays were used (24 SCN and 55 WB samples, 4 different microarray plat-forms), alongside 17 RNA-Seq data files (7 SCN and 10 WB). 31 684 MGI gene symbols had data for at least one platform. Meta-analysis using a random ef-fects model for weighting individual effect sizes (de-rived from differential expression between relevant SCN and WB samples) reliably detected known SCN markers. SCN-enriched transcripts identified in this study provide novel insights into SCN function, in-cluding identifying genes which may play key roles in SCN physiology or provide SCN-specific drivers.},

abstract = {Following the primary mechanical impact, traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces the simultaneous production of a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory molecular mediators. Given the variety of cell types and their requisite expression of cognate receptors this creates a highly complex inflammatory milieu. Increasingly in neurotrauma research there has been an effort to define injury-induced inflammatory responses within the context of in vitro defined macrophage polarization phenotypes, known as "M1" and "M2". Herein, we expand upon our previous work in a rodent model of TBI to show that the categorization of inflammatory response cannot be so easily delineated using this nomenclature. Specifically, we show that TBI elicited a wide spectrum of concurrent expression responses within both pro- and anti-inflammatory arms. Moreover, we show that the cells principally responsible for the production of these inflammatory mediators, microglia/macrophages, simultaneously express both "M1" and "M2" phenotypic markers. Overall, these data align with recent reports suggesting that microglia/macrophages cannot adequately switch to a polarized "M1-only" or "M2-only" phenotype, but display a mixed phenotype due to the complex signaling events surrounding them.},

After cross platform normalization, the merged sample data were grouped together and were subjected to statistical analysis for finding discriminate genes. Gene enrichments with their corresponding functions were analyzed by the online analysis engine "Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery" (DAVID) 6.7, and genes interactions and functional networks were further analyzed by STRING 9.0 and Cytoscape 3.0.0 Beta1. One hundred and thirty signature genes could potentially differentiate one disease state from another. Compared with normal lung tissue, tissue affected by IPF and sarcoidosis displayed similar signatures that concentrated on proliferation and differentiation. Distinctly expressed genes that could distinguish IPF from sarcoidosis are more enriched in processes of cilium biogenesis or degradation and regulating T cell activations. Key discriminative network modules involve aspects of bone morphogenetic protein receptor two (BMPR2) related and v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene (MYB) related proliferation.{\$}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}n{\$}\backslashbackslash{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first attempt to examine the transcriptional regulation of IPF and sarcoidosis across different studies based on different working platforms.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to current therapy and often leads to death. However, the rate of disease progression differs among patients. We hypothesized that comparing the gene expression profiles between patients with stable disease and those in which the disease progressed rapidly will lead to biomarker discovery and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To begin to address this hypothesis, we applied Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate lung expression profiles from diagnostic surgical lung biopsies in 6 individuals with relatively stable (or slowly progressive) IPF and 6 individuals with progressive IPF (based on changes in DLCO and FVC over 12 months). Our results indicate that this comprehensive lung IPF SAGE transcriptome is distinct from normal lung tissue and other chronic lung diseases. To identify candidate markers of disease progression, we compared the IPF SAGE profiles in stable and progressive disease, and identified a set of 102 transcripts that were at least 5-fold up regulated and a set of 89 transcripts that were at least 5-fold down regulated in the progressive group (P-value{\textless}/=0.05). The over expressed genes included surfactant protein A1, two members of the MAPK-EGR-1-HSP70 pathway that regulate cigarette-smoke induced inflammation, and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated), a gene not previously implicated in IPF. Interestingly, 26 of the up regulated genes are also increased in lung adenocarcinomas and have low or no expression in normal lung tissue. More importantly, we defined a SAGE molecular expression signature of 134 transcripts that sufficiently distinguished relatively stable from progressive IPF. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of diagnosis could prove helpful in predicting the likelihood of disease progression or possibly understanding the biological activity of IPF.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {The lung hosts multiple populations of macrophages and dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in lung pathology. The accurate identification and enumeration of these subsets are essential for understanding their role in lung pathology. Flow cytometry is a mainstream tool for studying the immune system. However, a systematic flow cytometric approach to identify subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) accurately and consistently in the normal mouse lung has not been described. Here we developed a panel of surface markers and an analysis strategy that accurately identify all known populations of macrophages and DCs, and their precursors in the lung during steady-state conditions and bleomycin-induced injury. Using this panel, we assessed the polarization of lung macrophages during the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Alveolar macrophages expressed markers of alternatively activated macrophages during both acute and fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury, whereas markers of classically activated macrophages were expressed only during the acute phase. Taken together, these data suggest that this flow cytometric panel is very helpful in identifying macrophage and DC populations and their state of activation in normal, injured, and fibrotic lungs.},

abstract = {Inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages are key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. After tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically.},

The versatility of antibodies is demonstrated by the various functions that they mediate such as neutralization, agglutination, fixation with activation of complement and activation of effector cells. Naturally occurring antibodies protect the organism against harmful pathogens, viruses and infections. In addition, almost any organic chemical induces antibody production of antibodies that would bind specifically to the chemical. These antibodies are often produced from multiple B cell clones and referred to as polyclonal antibodies. In recent years, scientists have exploited the highly evolved machinery of the immune system to produce structurally and functionally complex molecules such as antibodies from a single B clone, heralding the era of monoclonal antibodies. Most of the antibodies currently in the clinic, target components of the immune system, are not curative and seek to alleviate symptoms rather than cure disease. Our group used a novel strategy to identify reparative human monoclonal antibodies distinct from conventional antibodies. In this chapter, we discuss the therapeutic relevance of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in clinic.},

abstract = {A novel, MS-based approach for the relative quantification of proteins, relying on the derivatization of primary amino groups in intact proteins using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is presented. Due to the isobaric mass design of the iTRAQ reagents, differentially labeled proteins do not differ in mass; accordingly, their corresponding proteolytic peptides appear as single peaks in MS scans. Because quantitative information is provided by isotope-encoded reporter ions that can only be observed in MS/MS spectra, we analyzed the fragmentation behavior of ESI and MALDI ions of peptides generated from iTRAQ-labeled proteins using a TOF/TOF and/or a QTOF instrument. We observed efficient liberation of reporter ions for singly protonated peptides at low-energy collision conditions. In contrast, increased collision energies were required to liberate the iTRAQ label from lysine side chains of doubly charged peptides and, thus, to observe reporter ions suitable for relative quantification of proteins with high accuracy. We then developed a quantitative strategy that comprises labeling of intact proteins by iTRAQ followed by gel electrophoresis and peptide MS/MS analyses. As proof of principle, mixtures of five different proteins in various concentration ratios were quantified, demonstrating the general applicability of the approach presented here to quantitative MS-based proteomics.},

abstract = {Alveolar macrophages exist in a unique microenvironment and, despite historical evidence showing that they are in close contact with the respiratory epithelium, have until recently been investigated in isolation. The microenvironment of the airway lumen has a considerable influence on many aspects of alveolar macrophage phenotype, function and turnover. As the lungs adapt to environmental challenges, so too do alveolar macrophages adapt to accommodate the ever-changing needs of the tissue. In this Review, we discuss the unique characteristics of alveolar macrophages, the mechanisms that drive their adaptation and the direct and indirect influences of epithelial cells on them. We also highlight how airway luminal macrophages function as sentinels of a healthy state and how they do not respond in a pro-inflammatory manner to antigens that do not disrupt lung structure. The unique tissue location and function of alveolar macrophages distinguish them from other macrophage populations and suggest that it is important to classify macrophages according to the site that they occupy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes reportedly play important roles in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic agent; however, its effects on fibrocytes have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pirfenidone inhibits fibrocyte pool size in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. METHODS: Bleomycin (100 mg/kg) was infused with osmotic pumps into C57BL/6 mice, and pirfenidone (300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily for 2 wk. The lungs were removed, and single-cell suspensions were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to detect fibrocytes, which were defined as CD45 and collagen-I double-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the lung specimens to quantify fibrocytes. Chemokines in the lung digests were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of pirfenidone on alveolar macrophages was evaluated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In a therapeutic setting, pirfenidone administration was initiated 10 days after bleomycin treatment. For chemotaxis assay, lung fibrocytes were isolated with immunomagnetic selection (CD45-positive mesenchymal cells) after culture and allowed to migrate toward chemokines in the presence or absence of pirfenidone. Moreover, the effect of pirfenidone on the expression of chemokine receptors on fibrocytes was evaluated. RESULTS: Pirfenidone significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis as assessed with quantitative histology and collagen measurement. Fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mice lungs was attenuated from 26.5{\%} to 13.7{\%} by pirfenidone on FACS analysis. This outcome was also observed in a therapeutic setting. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrocytes were significantly decreased by pirfenidone administration compared with those in bleomycin-treated mice (P = 0.0097). Increased chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) and CCL12 production in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs was significantly attenuated by pirfenidone (P = 0.0003 and P {\textless}0.0001, respectively). Pirfenidone also attenuated macrophage counts stimulated by bleomycin in BAL fluid. Fibrocyte migration toward CCL2 and chemokine (CC motif) receptor-2 expression on fibrocytes was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone attenuated the fibrocyte pool size in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs via attenuation of CCL2 and CCL12 production in vivo, and fibrocyte migration was inhibited by pirfenidone in vitro. Fibrocyte inhibition is considered a mechanism of anti-fibrotic action of pirfenidone.},

abstract = {Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF5 that lead to higher mRNA expression are associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IRF5 expression in macrophages was reversibly induced by inflammatory stimuli and contributed to the plasticity of macrophage polarization. High expression of IRF5 was characteristic of M1 macrophages, in which it directly activated transcription of the genes encoding interleukin 12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40), IL-12p35 and IL-23p19 and repressed the gene encoding IL-10. Consequently, those macrophages set up the environment for a potent T helper type 1 (T(H)1)-T(H)17 response. Global gene expression analysis demonstrated that exogenous IRF5 upregulated or downregulated expression of established phenotypic markers of M1 or M2 macrophages, respectively. Our data suggest a critical role for IRF5 in M1 macrophage polarization and define a previously unknown function for IRF5 as a transcriptional repressor.},

Methods: TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from normal controls (NCs; n = 40) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 100), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 20), and sarcoidosis (n = 19). Results: The TSLP and IL-33 levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF relative to the NCs (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively), NSIP (p = 4.95E - 7 and p = 0.0002, respectively), HP (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.000005, respectively), and sarcoidosis groups (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively). However, the IL-25 levels were not significantly different between NC and IPF group (p = 0.432). Receiver operating characteristic curves of the TSLP and IL-33 levels revealed clear differences between the IPF and NC groups (AUC = 0.655 and 0.706, respectively), as well as between the IPF and the other lung disease groups (AUC = 0.786 and 0.781, respectively). Cut-off values of 3.52 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 3.77 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 were shown to differentiate between the IPF and NC groups with 99.2 and 94.3{\%} accuracy. Cut-off values of 4.66 pg/$\mu$g TSLP and 2.52 pg/$\mu$g IL-33 possessed 99.4 and 93.2{\%} accuracy for differentiating among the IPF and other interstitial lung disease groups. Conclusions: Innate immune responses may be associated with the development of IPF. Furthermore, the IL-33 and TSLP levels in BAL fluids may be useful for differentiating IPF from other chronic interstitial lung diseases.},

How did we get here? And where are we going? This book takes us on an exhilarating journey through the revolution in data analysis following the introduction of electronic computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference. The book ends with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.},

The fish kill, which lasted almost simultaneously with the bloom of the organism had its peak when the organisms bloom was declining.

Losses due to the fish kill were estimated at six million pesos (equivalent to US{\$} 120,000), which includes only the worth of dead cultivated fish. Lack of oxygen in the cages and pens was the fundamental cause of the fish kill, and toxicity of the Prorocentrum could not be confirmed.

abstract = {The lung is exposed to a vast array of inhaled antigens, particulate matter, and pollution. Cells present in the airways must therefore be maintained in a generally suppressive phenotype so that excessive responses to nonserious irritants do not occur; these result in bystander damage to lung architecture, influx of immune cells to the airways, and consequent impairment of gas exchange. To this end, the resident cells of the lung, which are predominantly macrophages, are kept in a dampened state. However, on occasion the suppression fails and these macrophages overreact to antigenic challenge, resulting in release of inflammatory mediators, induction of death of lung epithelial cells, deposition of extracellular matrix, and development of immunopathology. In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms behind this macrophage-mediated pathology, in the context of a number of inflammatory pulmonary disorders.},

This continually transports toxic chemicals and particles or pathogenic microorganisms deep into the respiratory system, posing a challenge to physicochemical barriers and the local immune system. Thus, complex structures and mechanisms have evolved to recognize and fend off environmental dangers while at the same time allowing efficient gas exchange. Here we review our current knowledge regarding cellular mechanisms of the immune system in context with the highly specialized anatomical features of the airways and especially the alveolar compartment. The focus is on fungal and viral infections, merging anatomical aspects well known to pulmonologists with fundamental immunological concepts. We discuss the specialized morphological constraints of immune cells compressed under a continuous layer of the surfactant lining within alveoli as well as the importance of functional polarization of respiratory tract epithelia. Furthermore, we summarize the different types of innate and adaptive immune cells and their relative contribution to lung homeostasis with respect to localization. Finally, we provide a list of currently unresolved questions with high relevance for the field that might serve as food for thought regarding future research directions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Combining multiple microarray datasets increases sample size and leads to improved reproducibility in identification of informative genes and subsequent clinical prediction. Although microarrays have increased the rate of genomic data collection, sample size is still a major issue when identifying informative genetic biomarkers. Because of this, feature selection methods often suffer from false discoveries, resulting in poorly performing predictive models. We develop a simple meta-analysis-based feature selection method that captures the knowledge in each individual dataset and combines the results using a simple rank average. In a comprehensive study that measures robustness in terms of clinical application (i.e., breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer), microarray platform heterogeneity, and classifier (i.e., logistic regression, diagonal LDA, and linear SVM), we compare the rank average meta-analysis method to five other meta-analysis methods. Results indicate that rank average meta-analysis consistently performs well compared to five other meta-analysis methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 are important initiators of type 2-associated mucosal inflammation and immunity. However, their role in the maintenance of progressive type 2 inflammation and fibrosis is much less clear. Using chronic models of helminth infection and allergic lung inflammation, we show that collective disruption of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 signaling suppresses chronic and progressive type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation and fibrosis. In a schistosome lung granuloma model or during chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection in the liver, individual ablation of TSLP, IL-25, or IL-33/ST2 had no impact on the development of IL-4/IL-13-dependent inflammation or fibrosis. However, significant reductions in granuloma-associated eosinophils, hepatic fibrosis, and IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were observed when signaling of all three mediators was simultaneously disrupted. Combined blockade through monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment also reduced IL-5 and IL-13 expression during primary and secondary granuloma formation in the lungs. In a model of chronic house dust mite-induced allergic lung inflammation, combined mAb treatment did not decrease established inflammation or fibrosis. TSLP/IL-33 double-knockout mice treated with anti-IL-25 mAb during priming, however, displayed decreased inflammation, mucus production, and lung remodeling in the chronic phase. Together, these studies reveal partially redundant roles for TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in the maintenance of type 2 pathology and suggest that in some settings, early combined targeting of these mediators is necessary to ameliorate progressive type 2-driven disease.},

abstract = {The B7 family consists of structurally related, cell-surface protein ligands, which bind to receptors on lymphocytes that regulate immune responses. Activation of T and B lymphocytes is initiated by engagement of cell-surface, antigen-specific T-cell receptors or B-cell receptors, but additional signals delivered simultaneously by B7 ligands determine the ultimate immune response. These 'costimulatory' or 'coinhibitory' signals are delivered by B7 ligands through the CD28 family of receptors on lymphocytes. Interaction of B7-family members with costimulatory receptors augments immune responses, and interaction with coinhibitory receptors attenuates immune responses. There are currently seven known members of the family: B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), inducible costimulator ligand (ICOS-L), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), programmed death-2 ligand (PD-L2), B7-H3, and B7-H4. Members of the family have been characterized predominantly in humans and mice, but some members are also found in birds. They share 20-40{\%} amino-acid identity and are structurally related, with the extracellular domain containing tandem domains related to variable and constant immunoglobulin domains. B7 ligands are expressed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The importance of the family in regulating immune responses is shown by the development of immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases in mice with mutations in B7-family genes. Manipulation of the signals delivered by B7 ligands has shown potential in the treatment of autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathogenic changes in lung protein expression in IPF and to evaluate apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I as a candidate therapeutic molecule. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was adopted for differential display proteomics. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA were performed for identification and quantitative measurement of Apo A-I in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF and experimental bleomycin-induced mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen protein spots showed differences in relative intensity between IPF (n = 14) and healthy control subjects (n = 8). Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed increase of haptoglobulin and decrease of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, macrophage capping protein, angiotensinogen, hemoglobin chain B, Apo A-I, clusterin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, immunoglobulin, and complement C4A in IPF compared with normal control subjects (P = 0.006-0.044). Apo A-I concentrations were lower in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from subjects with IPF (n = 28) than in normal control subjects (n = 18; P {\textless} 0.01). In bleomycin-treated mice, Apo A-I protein in BALF was lower than that in sham-treated control animals. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining on intraalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells of the lungs. Intranasal treatment with Apo A-I protein reduced the bleomycin-induced increases in number of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition in sham-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of several inflammatory and antiinflammatory proteins in the lungs may be related to the pathogenesis of IPF, and local treatment with Apo A-I is very effective against the development of experimental lung injury and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Lung macrophages have been reported to regulate both progression and remission of bleomycin-induced diffuse PF. However, it remains unclear how macrophages contribute to silica-induced progressive nodular PF and the associated tissue cell responses in vivo. We found that lack of monocyte-derived macrophages results in the formation of diffuse PF after silica instillation. We found that the proportion and the number of monocyte-derived macrophages were persistently higher in silica-induced progressive PF compared with bleomycin-induced PF. Surprisingly, in Ccr2-/-mice, in which monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration is impaired, silica administration induced diffuse PF with loose nodule formation and greater activation of tissue cells. In the diffuse lesions, the distribution of epithelial cells, distribution of myofibroblasts, and architecture of the basement membrane were disrupted. Consistent with the development of diffuse lesions, genes that were differentially expressed in CD45-tissue cells from the lung of wild-type and Ccr2-/-mice were highly enriched in human diffuse, progressive PF. In gene ontology network analyses, many of these genes were associated with tissue remodeling and included genes not previously associated with PF, such as Mmp14, Thbs2, and Fgfr4. Overall, these results indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages prevent transition from nodular to diffuse silica-induced PF, potentially by regulating tissue cell responses.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4{\%} and 83.4+8{\%} in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value {\textgreater}0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value {\textgreater}0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value {\textgreater}0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value {\textgreater}0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The ex vivo finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value {\textgreater}0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.},

The role of MyD88 signaling in early pulmonary inflammation and fungal clearance was evaluated in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and MyD88-deficient (MyD88-/-) mice. Early ({\textless}48 h) after infection, MyD88-/- mice had higher fungal burdens than those of WT mice, although fungal burdens rapidly declined ({\textgreater}72 h) in both. MyD88-/- mice had less consolidated inflammation, with fewer NK cells, in lung tissue early (24 h) after infection than did WT mice. At the latter time point, MyD88-/- mouse lungs were characterized by a large amount of necrotic cellular debris and fibrin, while WT lungs had organized inflammation. Although there were equivalent numbers of macrophages in WT and MyD88-/- mouse lung tissues, MyD88-/- cells demonstrated delayed uptake of green fluorescent protein-expressing A. fumigatus (GFP-Af293); histologically, MyD88-/- mouse lungs had more hyphal invasion of terminal airways and vessels, the appearance of bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis, and necrotizing vasculitis. MyD88-/- lung homogenates contained comparatively decreased amounts of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, KC, and gamma interferon and paradoxically increased amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha. These data indicate that the MyD88-dependent pathway mediates acute pulmonary fungal clearance, inflammation, and tissue injury very early after infection. Resolution of abnormalities within a 3-day window demonstrates the importance of redundant signaling pathways in mediating pulmonary inflammatory responses to fungi.},

abstract = {Inflammation is an immune response triggered by microbial invasion and/or tissue injury. While acute inflammation is directed toward invading pathogens and injured cells, thus enabling tissue regeneration, chronic inflammation can lead to severe pathologies and tissue dysfunction. These processes are linked with macrophage polarization into specific inflammatory "M1-like" or regulatory "M2-like" subsets. Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs), produced endogenously as byproducts of metabolism and oxidative inflammatory conditions, may be useful for treating diseases associated with dysregulated immune homeostasis. The goal of this study was to characterize the role of nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) in regulating the functional specialization of macrophages induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4, and to reveal specific signaling mechanisms which can account for OA-NO2-dependent modulation of inflammation and fibrotic responses. Our results show that OA-NO2inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of both pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines (including transforming growth factor-$\beta$) and inhibits nitric oxide and superoxide anion production. OA-NO2also decreases interleukin-4-induced macrophage responses by inhibiting arginase-I expression and transforming growth factor-$\beta$ production. These effects are mediated via downregulation of signal transducers and activators of transcription, mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kB signaling responses. Finally, OA-NO2inhibits fibrotic processes in an in vivo model of angiotensin II-induced myocardial fibrosis by attenuating expression of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin, systemic transforming growth factor-$\beta$ levels and infiltration of both "M1-" and "M2-like" macrophage subsets into afflicted tissue. Overall, the electrophilic fatty acid derivative OA-NO2modulates a broad range of "M1-" and "M2-like" macrophage functions and represents a potential therapeutic approach to target diseases associated with dysregulated macrophage subsets.},

abstract = {Fibrosis is a basic connective tissue lesion defined by the increase in the fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissue or organ. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of proteases known to regulate the turn-over of ECM and so they are suggested to be important in tissue remodelling observed during fibrogenic process associated with chronic inflammation. Tissue remodelling is the result of an imbalance in the equilibrium of the normal processes of synthesis and degradation of ECM components markedly controlled by the MMPs/TIMP imbalance. We previously showed an association of the differences in collagen deposition in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with a reduced molar pro-MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio. Using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) preclinical model of liver fibrosis in mice, we observed a significant increase in collagen deposition with increased expression and release of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 both at 24 h and 3 weeks later. This suggests an early altered regulation of matrix turnover involved in the development of fibrosis. We also demonstrated an activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathway associated with the IL-1R/MyD88 signalling in the development of experimental fibrosis both in lung and liver. This was also associated with an increased expression of purinergic receptors mainly P2X7 Finally, these observations emphasize those effective therapies for these disorders must be given early in the natural history of the disease, prior to the development of tissue remodelling and fibrosis.},

abstract = {Monocytes are short-lived mononuclear phagocytes that circulate in the bloodstream and comprise two main subpopulations that in the mouse are best defined by the Ly6C marker. Intravascular functions of " classical " Ly6C + monocytes and their interactions with other lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes in the circulation remain poorly understood. Rather, these cells are known to efficiently extravasate into tissues. Indeed, Ly6C + monocytes and their descendants have emerged as a third, highly plastic and dynamic cellular system that complements the two classical, tissue-resident mononuclear phagocyte compartments, i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells, on demand. Following recruitment to injured tissue, Ly6C + monocytes respond to local cues and can critically contribute to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory reactions. The second main murine monocyte subset, Ly6C – cells, derive in steady state from Ly6C + monocytes and remain in the vasculature, where the cells act as scavengers. Moreover, a major fraction of Ly6C – monocytes adheres to the capillary endothelium and patrols the vessel wall for surveillance. Given the central role of monocytes in homeostasis and pathology, in-depth study of this cellular compartment can be highly informative on the health state of the organism and provides an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {A significant component of immune biology research is the investigation of protein encoding genes that play central roles in contributing inflammatory response. A gel-free quantitative bottom-up proteomics study was performed on immune cell macrophages after the combined treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and statin drugs using mass spectrometry and a detailed bioinformatics analyses were conducted. Systematic bioinformatics analysis was applied for discovering novel relationships among proteins and effects of statin and lipopolysaccharide in macrophage cells. Based on gene ontology, majority of protein encoding genes was involved in metabolic and cellular processes and are actively associated with binding, structural molecular, and catalytic activity. Notably, proteomic data analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), discovered the plectin and prohibitin 2 protein interactions network and inflammatory-disease based protein networks. Two up-regulated proteins, plectin and prohibitin 2, were further validated by immunoblotting. Plectin was also cross-validated by immunocytochemistry, since its expression was highly modulated by statin but inhibited during LPS-stimulation. Collectively, the significant up-regulation of plectin due to the treatment of statin, suggests that statin has a significant impact on the cytoskeletal networks of cells. Plectin might have a significant role in the intermediate filament assembly and dynamics, and possibly stabilizing and crosslinking intermediate filament networks.},

abstract = {Animal cell culture technology has advanced significantly over the last few decades and is now generally considered a reliable, robust and relatively mature technology. A range of biotherapeutics are currently synthesized using cell culture methods in large scale manufacturing facilities that produce products for both commercial use and clinical studies. The robust implementation of this technology requires optimization of a number of variables, including (1) cell lines capable of synthesizing the required molecules at high productivities that ensure low operating cost; (2) culture media and bioreactor culture conditions that achieve both the requisite productivity and meet product quality specifications; (3) appropriate on-line and off-line sensors capable of providing information that enhances process control; and (4) good understanding of culture performance at different scales to ensure smooth scale-up. Successful implementation also requires appropriate strategies for process development, scale-up and process characterization and validation that enable robust operation and ensure compliance with current regulations. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the art technology in key aspects of cell culture, e.g., generation of highly productive cell lines and optimization of cell culture process conditions. We also summarize the current thinking on appropriate process development strategies and process advances that might affect process development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {The preclinical model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, used to investigate mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has incorrectly predicted efficacy for several candidate compounds suggesting that it may be of limited value. As an attempt to improve the predictive nature of this model, integrative bioinformatic approaches were used to compare molecular alterations in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and patients with IPF. Using gene set enrichment analysis we show for the first time that genes differentially expressed during the fibrotic phase of the single challenge bleomycin model were significantly enriched in the expression profiles of IPF patients. The genes that contributed most to the enrichment were largely involved in mitosis, growth factor, and matrix signaling. Interestingly, these same mitotic processes were increased in the expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from rapidly progressing, but not slowly progressing, IPF patients relative to control subjects. The data also indicated that TGF{\$}\beta{\$} was not the sole mediator responsible for the changes observed in this model since the ALK-5 inhibitor SB525334 effectively attenuated some but not all of the fibrosis associated with this model. Although some would suggest that repetitive bleomycin injuries may more effectively model IPF-like changes, our data do not support this conclusion. Together, these data highlight that a single bleomycin instillation effectively replicates several of the specific pathogenic molecular changes associated with IPF, and may be best used as a model for patients with active disease.},

abstract = {Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in proteins has been critical to the understanding of protein dynamics and enzyme reactions using tryptophan as a molecular optical probe. We report here our systematic examinations of potential quenching residues with more than 40 proteins. With site-directed mutation, we placed tryptophan to desired positions or altered its neighboring residues to screen quenching groups among 20 amino acid residues and of peptide backbones. With femtosecond resolution, we observed the ultrafast quenching dynamics within 100 ps and identified two ultrafast quenching groups, the carbonyl- and sulfur-containing residues. The former is glutamine and glutamate residues and the later is disulfide bond and cysteine residue. The quenching by the peptide-bond carbonyl group as well as other potential residues mostly occurs in longer than 100 ps. These ultrafast quenching dynamics occur at van der Waals distances through intraprotein electron transfer with high directionality. Following optimal molecular orbital overlap, electron jumps from the benzene ring of the indole moiety in a vertical orientation to the LUMO of acceptor quenching residues. Molecular dynamics simulations were invoked to elucidate various correlations of quenching dynamics with separation distances, relative orientations, local fluctuations and reaction heterogeneity. These unique ultrafast quenching pairs, as recently found to extensively occur in high-resolution protein structures, may have significant biological implications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The master circadian pacemaker in mammals is lo-cated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) which reg-ulate physiology and behaviour, as well as coordi-nating peripheral clocks throughout the body. In-vestigating the function of the SCN has often fo-cused on the identification of rhythmically expressed genes. However, not all genes critical for SCN func-tion are rhythmically expressed. An alternative strat-egy is to characterize those genes that are selec-tively enriched in the SCN. Here, we examined the transcriptome of the SCN and whole brain (WB) of mice using meta-analysis of publicly deposited data across a range of microarray platforms and RNA-Seq data. A total of 79 microarrays were used (24 SCN and 55 WB samples, 4 different microarray plat-forms), alongside 17 RNA-Seq data files (7 SCN and 10 WB). 31 684 MGI gene symbols had data for at least one platform. Meta-analysis using a random ef-fects model for weighting individual effect sizes (de-rived from differential expression between relevant SCN and WB samples) reliably detected known SCN markers. SCN-enriched transcripts identified in this study provide novel insights into SCN function, in-cluding identifying genes which may play key roles in SCN physiology or provide SCN-specific drivers.},

abstract = {? 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.Macrophages are dynamic cells that mature under the influence of signals from the local microenvironment into either classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated macrophages with specific functional and phenotypic properties. Although the phenotypic identification of M1 and M2 macrophages is well established in mice, this is less clear for human macrophages. In addition, the persistence and reversibility of polarized human phenotypes is not well established. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into uncommitted macrophages (M0) and then polarized to M1 and M2 phenotypes using LPS/IFN-g and IL-4/IL-13, respectively. M1 and M2 were identified as CD641CD801 and CD11b1CD2091, respectively, by flow cytometry. Polarized M1 cells secreted IP-10, IFN-g, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-1b, and RANTES, whereas M2 cells secreted IL-13, CCL17, and CCL18. Functionally, M2 cells were highly endocytic. In cytokine-deficient medium, the polarized macrophages reverted back to the M0 state within 12 days. If previously polarized macrophages were given the alternative polarizing stimulus after 6 days of resting in cytokine-deficient medium, a switch in polarization was seen (i.e., M1 macrophages switched to M2 and expressed CD11b1CD2091 and vice versa). In summary, we report phenotypic identification of human M1 and M2 macrophages, their functional characteristics, and their ability to be reprogrammed given the appropriate stimuli.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether leptin deficiency promoted the development of ALI. LPS or oleic acid (OA) were administered to wild-type and leptin deficient (ob/ob) mice to induce ALI. Leptin level, survival rate, and lung injury were examined. Results showed that leptin levels were predominantly increased in the lung, but also in the heart, liver, kidney, and adipose tissue after LPS adminiatration. Compared with wild-type mice, LPS- or OA-induced lung injury was worse and the survival rate was lower in ob/ob mice. Moreover, leptin deficiency promoted the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Exogenous administration of leptin reduced lethality in ob/ob mice and ameliorated lung injury partly through inhibiting the activation of NF-$\kappa$B, p38, and ERK pathways. These results indicated that leptin deficiency contributed to the development of lung injury by enhancing inflammatory response, and a high level of leptin improved survival and protected against ALI.},

abstract = {Grooming might be a resource that is offered in exchange for some benefit (e.g. access to a feeding site or coalitionary support) or it might be a mechanism for building and servicing social relationships, whose function, in turn, is to facilitate the exchange of resources and services. Bi-directional (or simultaneous mutual) grooming is unusually common among chimpanzees (though rare in other primates) and we suggest that this might be because it is an especially strong indicator of social bonding. Because the bonding role of bi-directional grooming offers substantially different predictions from the interpretation offered by the models based on reciprocal altruism (RA), we use a critical tests methodology (i.e. tests that unequivocally support one hypothesis at the expense of the other) to differentiate between the bonding and RA hypotheses. We use data on the dynamics of grooming interactions from a captive group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to show that dominant individuals tolerated the individuals with whom they performed bi-directional grooming more than they did those who typically provided them unidirectional grooming. Dominants rejected and terminated grooming sessions more often with the individuals who provided them with mostly unidirectional grooming than with those with whom they groomed bi-directionally. In addition, animals engaged in bi-directional grooming more often with both relatives and those with whom they were often in proximity. These results support the bonding model of mutually reciprocated grooming at the expense of the RA model, and suggest that, at least in chimpanzees, simultaneous mutual grooming may play a particularly important role in social bonding.},

This has resulted in rapid expansion of global manufacturing capacity [1], an increase in size of reactors (up to 20,000??L) and a greatly increased effort to improve process efficiency with concomitant manufacturing cost reduction. This has been particularly successful in the upstream part of the process where productivity of cell cultures has improved 100??fold in the last 15??years. This success has resulted from improvements in expression technology and from process optimisation, especially the development of fed-batch cultures. In addition to improving process/cost efficiencies, a second key area has been reducing the time taken to develop processes and produce the first material required for clinical testing and proof-of-principle. Cell line creation is often the slowest step in this stage of process development.

abstract = {Monocytes and macrophages provide the first line of defense against pathogens. They also initiate acquired immunity by processing and presenting antigens and pro- vide the downstream effector functions. Analysis of large gene expression datasets from multiple cells and tissues reveals sets of genes that are co-regulated with the transcription factors that regulate them. In macrophages, the gene clusters include lineage-specific genes, interferon-responsive genes, early inflammatory genes, and genes required for endocytosis and lysosome function. Macrophages enter tissues and alter their function to deal with a wide range of challenges related to development and organogenesis, tissue injury, malignancy, sterile, or pathogenic inflammatory stimuli. These stimuli alter the gene expression to produce “activated macrophages” that are better equipped to eliminate the cause of their influx and to restore homeostasis. Activation or polarization states of macrophages have been classified as “classical” and “alternative” or M1 and M2. These proposed states of cells are not supported by large-scale transcriptomic data, including macrophage-associated signatures from large cancer tissue datasets, where the supposed markers do not correlate with other. Individual macrophage cells differ markedly from each other, and change their func- tions in response to doses and combinations of agonists and time. The most studied macrophage activation response is the transcriptional cascade initiated by the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. This response is reviewed herein. The network topology is conserved across species, but genes within the transcriptional network evolve rapidly and differ between mouse and human. There is also considerable divergence in the sets of target genes between mouse strains, between individuals, and in other species such as pigs. The deluge of complex information related to macrophage activation can be accessed with new analytical tools and new databases that provide access for the non-expert. Keywords:},

abstract = {Many human lung cancer cell lines express apolipoprotein E (ApoE), especially cells derived from malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the influence of ApoE expression on lung cancer. In lung cancer tissues, ApoE expression was more frequently found in malignant pleural effusions (MPE)-associated lung adenocarcinoma than in lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma without MPE (P{\textless}0.05), indicating that ApoE is associated with the pathogenesis of MPE in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Next, we examined the roles of ApoE in an MPE-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line that endogenously over-expresses ApoE, PC14PE6/AS2 (AS2). In that experiment we inhibited ApoE expression by transfection of a plasmid carrying ApoE siRNAs into AS2 cells to generate AS-S2 and AS-S3 cells. Compared to vector-control cells and parental AS2 cells, AS2-S2 and AS2-S3 cells grew slower (P{\textless}0.05), were more sensitive to cisplatin, and had significantly impaired cellular migration (P{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, over-expression of ApoE was independently associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients who had MPE at the time of diagnosis (P{\textless}0.001). Conclusively, ApoE over-expression promotes cancer proliferation and migration and contributes to an aggressive clinical course in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and MPE. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Monocytes are short-lived mononuclear phagocytes that circulate in the bloodstream and comprise two main subpopulations that in the mouse are best defined by the Ly6C marker. Intravascular functions of " classical " Ly6C + monocytes and their interactions with other lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes in the circulation remain poorly understood. Rather, these cells are known to efficiently extravasate into tissues. Indeed, Ly6C + monocytes and their descendants have emerged as a third, highly plastic and dynamic cellular system that complements the two classical, tissue-resident mononuclear phagocyte compartments, i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells, on demand. Following recruitment to injured tissue, Ly6C + monocytes respond to local cues and can critically contribute to the initiation and resolution of inflammatory reactions. The second main murine monocyte subset, Ly6C – cells, derive in steady state from Ly6C + monocytes and remain in the vasculature, where the cells act as scavengers. Moreover, a major fraction of Ly6C – monocytes adheres to the capillary endothelium and patrols the vessel wall for surveillance. Given the central role of monocytes in homeostasis and pathology, in-depth study of this cellular compartment can be highly informative on the health state of the organism and provides an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.},

Purified fusion protein yields were 1.9, 1.7 and 5.3 mg/l of cell culture for GST-rTp47, GST-rTp17 and GST-rTp15, respectively. The identities of the antigens obtained were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using ABI Prism 310 and peptide mapping by Finningan LC/MS. These recombinant antigens were evaluated by immuno-slot blot techniques applied to 137 serum samples from patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of syphilis (61 samples), from healthy blood donors (50 samples), individuals with sexually transmitted disease other than syphilis (3 samples), and from individuals with other spirochetal diseases such as Lyme disease (20 samples) and leptospirosis (3 samples). The assay had sensitivity of 95.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 86.1 to 98.7{\%}) and a specificity of 94.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 87.0 to 98.7{\%}); a stronger reactivity was observed with fraction rTp17.

Therefore, the aim was to investigate the role of necroptosis in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) and assess the effect of Nec-1 on lung injury in ARDS. Our results found that RIPK1, RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) were abundantly expressed in rat lung tissues of OA-induced ARDS. Nec-1 pretreatment improved pulmonary function and attenuated lung edema dramatically in OA-induced ARDS rats. Furthermore, Nec-1 reduced RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction and down-regulated RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signal pathway, and inhibited inflammatory response by reducing neutrophil infiltration and protein leakage into lung tissue in OA-induced ARDS. Collectively, our study proves the intervention of necroptosis in OA-induced ARDS. Moreover, our findings imply that Nec-1 plays an important role in the treatment of ARDS via inhibiting necroptosis and inflammation.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients. In the immunocompetent host, inhaled conidia are cleared by alveolar macrophages. The signaling pathways of the alveolar macrophage involved in the clearance of A. fumigatus are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of TLRs in the immune response against A. fumigatus and their contribution to the signaling events triggered in murine alveolar macrophages upon infection with A. fumigatus conidia. Specifically, we examined the MAPKs and NF-kappaB activation and cytokine signaling. Our investigations revealed that immunocompetent TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 knockout mice were not more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis as compared with wild-type mice and that the in vitro phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK and p38 was not affected in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 knockout mice following stimulation with conidia. In vivo experiments suggest that ERK was an essential MAPK in the defense against A. fumigatus, whereas the activation of NF-kappaB appeared to play only a secondary role. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TLR2/4 recognition and MyD88 signaling are dispensable for the clearance of A. fumigatus under immunocompetent situations. Furthermore, our data stress the important role of ERK activation in innate immunity to A. fumigatus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Animal models have suggested that CCR2-dependent signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, but global blockade of CCL2 failed to improve the clinical course of patients with lung fibrosis. However, as levels of CCR2+CD4+T cells in paediatric lung fibrosis had previously been found to be increased, correlating with clinical symptoms, we hypothesised that distinct CCR2+cell populations might either increase or decrease disease pathogenesis depending on their subtype. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of CCR2+CD4+T cells in experimental lung fibrosis and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrosis. METHODS Pulmonary CCR2+CD4+T cells were analysed using flow cytometry and mRNA profiling, followed by in silico pathway analysis, in vitro assays and adoptive transfer experiments. RESULTS Frequencies of CCR2+CD4+T cells were increased in experimental fibrosis-specifically the CD62L-CD44+effector memory T cell phenotype, displaying a distinct chemokine receptor profile. mRNA profiling of isolated CCR2+CD4+T cells from fibrotic lungs suggested immune regulatory functions, a finding that was confirmed in vitro using suppressor assays. Importantly, adoptive transfer of CCR2+CD4+T cells attenuated fibrosis development. The results were partly corroborated in patients with lung fibrosis, by showing higher percentages of Foxp3+CD25+cells within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CCR2+CD4+T cells as compared with CCR2-CD4+T cells. CONCLUSION Pulmonary CCR2+CD4+T cells are immunosuppressive, and could attenuate lung inflammation and fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies completely abrogating CCR2-dependent signalling will therefore also eliminate cell populations with protective roles in fibrotic lung disease. This emphasises the need for a detailed understanding of the functions of immune cell subsets in fibrotic lung disease.},

abstract = {Introduction: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) has prognostic value in various pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We determined the individual prognostic accuracy of distance walked and oxygen saturation during the 6MWT in patients with IPF. We defined a new composite index, the distance-saturation product (DSP), which is the product of distance walked and lowest oxygen saturation during the 6-min walk test. We compared the performance of the DSP to the individual 6MWT parameters in predicting mortality. Methods: We evaluated pulmonary function tests, 6-min walk parameters and the DSP between survivors and non-survivors. The ability of each measure to discriminate outcomes was determined by receiver operator curves. Results: 81 patients (48 survivors, 33 non-survivors) were included. Pulmonary function tests were similar and did not correlate with survival. Desaturation was greater (89.4{\%} versus 83.7{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and distance walked was lower (406.9 versus 181.3 m, P = 0.005) in non-survivors. The DSP was significantly lower among non-survivors (364.8 versus 153.5 m{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and predicted mortality more accurately than either individual 6MWT component (P = 0.035 versus desaturation, P = 0.040 versus distance). A DSP {\textless}200 m{\%} was associated with a seven-fold greater risk of 12-month mortality and an 18.0{\%} shorter median survival compared with a DSP{\textgreater}200 m{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). Discussion: Each component of the 6-min walk independently predicted mortality in IPF with greater accuracy than spirometry. However, a composite of both parameters, the DSP, provides slightly greater accuracy and represents a novel measure for assessing survival in patients with IPF.},

Overt respiratory infection and immunosuppression carry a high morbidity and mortality, and polymorphisms in genes related to epithelial integrity and host defense predispose to IPF.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with IPF according to international criteria together with healthy smokers, nonsmokers, and subjects with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as control subjects. Subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from which genomic DNA was isolated. The V3-V5 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified, allowing quantification of bacterial load and identification of communities by 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with IPF had double the burden of bacteria in BAL fluid compared with 44 control subjects. Baseline bacterial burden predicted the rate of decline in lung volume and risk of death and associated independently with the rs35705950 polymorphism of the MUC5B mucin gene, a proven host susceptibility factor for IPF. Sequencing yielded 912,883 high-quality reads from all subjects. We identified Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella spp. to be more abundant in cases than control subjects. Regression analyses indicated that these specific operational taxonomic units as well as bacterial burden associated independently with IPF.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: IPF is characterized by an increased bacterial burden in BAL that predicts decline in lung function and death. Trials of antimicrobial therapy are needed to determine if microbial burden is pathogenic in the disease.},

Our study examined the hypothesis that there were distinct differences in protein expression profiles that were related to the phenotype. From among the 323+/-51 protein spots that may represent the most highly expressed proteins in BALf of these patients, 24 unique spots were isolated and proteins identified. In particular, 9 spots were present in BALf of PM/DM patients only; 12 spots were exclusive of Overlap patients and 3 spots of AS patients. From among the proteins identified, a few were classified as cytoskeletal proteins, others were involved in oxidative stress and a number of proteins were associated with general metabolic activity or immunological response and inflammation. This is the first study in which evidence is provided that a number of different proteins are expressed in different subsets of PM/DM and supports our contention that the proteomic approach would be beneficial in discovering molecules which could represent possible prognostic factors of these rare pathologies.},

abstract = {Pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans infection of C57BL/6 mice is an established model of a chronic pulmonary fungal infection accompanied by an "allergic" response (T2) to the infection, i.e., a model of an allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Our objective was to determine whether IFN-gamma plays a role in regulating the pulmonary T2 immune response in C. neoformans-infected C57BL/6 mice. Long-term pulmonary fungistasis was lost in IFN-gamma knockout (KO) mice, resulting in an increased pulmonary burden of fungi at wk 3. IFN-gamma was required for the early influx of leukocytes into the lungs but was not required later in the infection. By wk 3, eosinophil and macrophage numbers were elevated in the absence of IFN-gamma. The inducible NO synthase to arginase ratio was lower in the lungs of IFN-gamma KO mice and the macrophages had increased numbers of intracellular cryptococci and YM1 crystals, indicative of alternatively activated macrophages in these mice. There was evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in both wild-type and IFN-gamma KO mice by 5 wk postinfection. IFN-gamma production was not required for the development of T2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) producing cells in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes or induction of an IgE response. At a number of time points, T2 cytokine production was enhanced in IFN-gamma KO mice. Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma, C57BL/6 mice develop an augmented allergic response to C. neoformans, including enhanced generation of alternatively activated macrophages, which is accompanied by a switch from a chronic to a progressive pulmonary cryptococcal infection.},

abstract = {The heart and blood vessels of a healthy individual contain resident immune cells, the majority of which are macrophages that have seeded these organs early in the development. In the mouse, ≈10{\%} of noncardiomyocytes are macrophages,1,2 and humans may have comparable numbers.1 After myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the heart through the combined effects of massive recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells and local self-renewal.1,3 Likewise, in atherosclerosis, the chronic lipid–driven inflammatory disease that is the underlying cause of myocardial infarction, macrophage numbers increase in the vessel wall, again because of recruitment and local proliferation.4 Although many of these insights have been generated in mouse models, compelling evidence from genome-wide association studies have associated innate immunity mediators with myocardial infarction,5 whereas prospective human studies have shown that blood monocyte levels can predict cardiovascular events in patients.6 

During the past decade, multiple studies have challenged and, in some cases, dismantled old assumptions about macrophage origins and functions. Many reviews and opinion pieces7–19—some of them our own20–23—have been written on the subject because the various communities interested in macrophage biology seek to contextualize the findings into a coherent narrative. We now know that, in the steady state, arterial24 and cardiac1,25–27 macrophages are mostly independent of monocytes, but in response to an inflammatory trigger, such as myocardial infarction or high-fat diet, monocyte-derived cells accumulate and differentiate to self-renewing macrophages.3,4,28,29 We also know that macrophage function goes far beyond phagocytosis. Because they reside in nearly every organ, macrophages respond and adapt to their local surroundings, and their noncanonical activities reflect their flexibility.

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal, chronic, progressive disease characterized by formation of scar tissue within the lungs. Because it is a disease of unknown etiology, it is difficult to diagnose, to predict disease course and to devise treatment strategies. Recent evidence suggests that activated macrophages play key roles in the pathology of IPF. Therefore, imaging probes that specifically recognize these pools of activated immune cells could provide valuable information about how these cells contribute to the pathobiology of the disease. Here we demonstrate that cysteine cathepsin-targeted imaging probes can be used to monitor the contribution of macrophages to fibrotic disease progression in the bleomycin-induced murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, we show that the probes highlight regions of macrophage involvement in fibrosis in human biopsy tissues from IPF patients. Finally, we present first-in-human results demonstrating non-invasive imaging of active cathepsins in fibrotic lesions of patients with IPF. Together, our findings validate small molecule cysteine cathepsin probes for clinical PET imaging and suggest that they have the potential to be used to generate mechanistically-informative molecular information regarding cellular drivers of IPF disease severity and progression.},

abstract = {? 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.Macrophages are dynamic cells that mature under the influence of signals from the local microenvironment into either classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated macrophages with specific functional and phenotypic properties. Although the phenotypic identification of M1 and M2 macrophages is well established in mice, this is less clear for human macrophages. In addition, the persistence and reversibility of polarized human phenotypes is not well established. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into uncommitted macrophages (M0) and then polarized to M1 and M2 phenotypes using LPS/IFN-g and IL-4/IL-13, respectively. M1 and M2 were identified as CD641CD801 and CD11b1CD2091, respectively, by flow cytometry. Polarized M1 cells secreted IP-10, IFN-g, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-1b, and RANTES, whereas M2 cells secreted IL-13, CCL17, and CCL18. Functionally, M2 cells were highly endocytic. In cytokine-deficient medium, the polarized macrophages reverted back to the M0 state within 12 days. If previously polarized macrophages were given the alternative polarizing stimulus after 6 days of resting in cytokine-deficient medium, a switch in polarization was seen (i.e., M1 macrophages switched to M2 and expressed CD11b1CD2091 and vice versa). In summary, we report phenotypic identification of human M1 and M2 macrophages, their functional characteristics, and their ability to be reprogrammed given the appropriate stimuli.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is known that tissue macrophages derive not only from blood monocytes but also from yolk sac or fetal liver, and the tissue of residence guides their function. When isolated, they lose tissue specific signatures, hence studies of human macrophages should be ideally done directly in the tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate directly in human lung tissue the polarization of alveolar macrophage (AM), classic (M1) or alternative (M2), in health and disease, using COPD as a model. METHODS Surgical lungs from 53 subjects were studied: 36 smokers whose FEV1 varied from normal to severe COPD, 11 non-smokers and 6 normal donors. iNOS and CD206 immunohistochemistry was used to quantify the percentage of AM polarized as M1 or M2 in lung sections. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The percentage of M1 and M2 increased progressively with smoking and COPD severity, from 26{\%} to 84{\%} for M1 and from 7{\%} to 78{\%} for M2. In donors 74{\%} of AM were negative for M1 and 93{\%} for M2. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of M1 and M2 in the same AM in severe COPD. CONCLUSION In normal lungs alveolar macrophages were mostly non-polarized. With smoking and COPD severity, M1 and M2 polarization increased significantly and so did the co-expression of M1 and M2 in the same alveolar macrophage.},

abstract = {Studies on monocyte and macrophage biology and differentiation have revealed the pleiotropic activities of these cells. Macrophages are tissue sentinels that maintain tissue integrity by eliminating/repairing damaged cells and matrices. In this M2-like mode, they can also promote tumor growth. Conversely, M1-like macrophages are key effector cells for the elimination of pathogens, virally infected, and cancer cells. Macrophage differentiation from monocytes occurs in the tissue in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype that depends on microenvironmental signals, thereby accounting for the many and apparently opposed macrophage functions. Many questions arise. When monocytes differentiate into macrophages in a tissue (concomitantly adopting a specific functional program, M1 or M2), do they all die during the inflammatory reaction, or do some of them survive? Do those that survive become quiescent tissue macrophages, able to react as na{\"{i}}ve cells to a new challenge? Or, do monocyte-derived tissue macrophages conserve a "memory" of their past inflammatory activation? This review will address some of these important questions under the general framework of the role of monocytes and macrophages in the initiation, development, resolution, and chronicization of inflammation.},

abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the number and demand for approved biopharmaceuticals produced from animal cell culture processes over the last few years. In part, this has been due to the efficacy of several humanized monoclonal antibodies that are required at large doses for therapeutic use. There have also been several identifiable advances in animal cell technology that has enabled efficient biomanufacture of these products. Gene vector systems allow high specific protein expression and some minimize the undesirable process of gene silencing that may occur in prolonged culture. Characterization of cellular metabolism and physiology has enabled the design of fed-batch and perfusion bioreactor processes that has allowed a significant improvement in product yield, some of which are now approaching 5 g/L. Many of these processes are now being designed in serum-free and animal-component-free media to ensure that products are not contaminated with the adventitious agents found in bovine serum. There are several areas that can be identified that could lead to further improvement in cell culture systems. This includes the down-regulation of apoptosis to enable prolonged cell survival under potentially adverse conditions. The characterization of the critical parameters of glycosylation should enable process control to reduce the heterogeneity of glycoforms so that production processes are consistent. Further improvement may also be made by the identification of glycoforms with enhanced biological activity to enhance clinical efficacy. The ability to produce the ever-increasing number of biopharmaceuticals by animal cell culture is dependent on sufficient bioreactor capacity in the industry. A recent shortfall in available worldwide culture capacity has encouraged commercial activity in contract manufacturing operations. However, some analysts indicate that this still may not be enough and that future manufacturing demand may exceed production capacity as the number of approved biotherapeutics increases.},

abstract = {Fibroblasts are the most common cell type of the connective tissues found throughout the body and the principal source of the extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristic of these tissues. They are also the central mediators of the pathological fibrotic accumulation of ECM and the cellular proliferation and differentiation that occurs in response to prolonged tissue injury and chronic inflammation. The transformation of the fibroblast cell lineage involves classical developmental signaling programs and includes a surprisingly diverse range of precursor cell types-most notably, myofibroblasts that are the apex of the fibrotic phenotype. Myofibroblasts display exaggerated ECM production; constitutively secrete and are hypersensitive to chemical signals such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; and are endowed with a contractile apparatus allowing them to manipulate the ECM fibers physically to close open wounds. In addition to ECM production, fibroblasts have multiple concomitant biological roles, such as in wound healing, inflammation, and angiogenesis, which are each interwoven with the process of fibrosis. We now recognize many common fibroblast-related features across various physiological and pathological protracted processes. Indeed, a new appreciation has emerged for the role of non-cancerous fibroblast interactions with tumors in cancer progression. Although the predominant current clinical treatments of fibrosis involve non-specific immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative drugs, a variety of potential therapies under investigation specifically target fibroblast biology.},

abstract = {Background: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem immuno-inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that most commonly involves the lungs. We hypothesized that an unbiased approach to identify pathways activated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells can shed light on the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Methods: We recruited 15 patients with various stages of sarcoidosis and 12 healthy controls. All subjects underwent bronchoscopy with lavage. For each subject, total RNA was extracted from BAL cells and hybridized to an Affymetrix U133A microarray. Rigorous statistical methods were applied to identify differential gene expression between subjects with sarcoidosis vs. controls. To better elucidate pathways differentially activated between these groups, we integrated network and gene set enrichment analyses of BAL cell transcriptional profiles. Results: Sarcoidosis patients were either non-smokers or former smokers, all had lung involvement and only two were on systemic prednisone. Healthy controls were all non-smokers. Comparison of BAL cell gene expression between sarcoidosis and healthy subjects revealed over 1500 differentially expressed genes. Several previously described immune mediators, such as interferon gamma, were upregulated in the sarcoidosis subjects. Using an integrative computational approach we constructed a modular network of over 80 gene sets that were highly enriched in patients with sarcoidosis. Many of these pathways mapped to inflammatory and immune-related processes including adaptive immunity, T-cell signaling, graft vs. host disease, interleukin 12, 23 and 17 signaling. Additionally, we uncovered a close association between the proteasome machinery and adaptive immunity, highlighting a potentially important and targetable relationship in the pathobiology of sarcoidosis. Conclusions: BAL cells in sarcoidosis are characterized by enrichment of distinct transcriptional programs involved in immunity and proteasomal processes. Our findings add to the growing evidence implicating alveolar resident immune effector cells in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and identify specific pathways whose activation may modulate disease progression.},

abstract = {Introduction Accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has important therapeutic and prognostic implications and would be greatly aided by reliable diagnostic biomarkers as IPF has sometimes overlapping features with other interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Objectives To explore the value of serum metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 7 levels in the differential diagnosis of IPF with other ILD. Methods MMP-1/7 serum levels were measured using Luminex xMAP technology in 139 patients- 47 IPF, 36 non-IPF Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), 14 idiopathic Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (iNSIP), 29 secondary NSIP (secNSIP), 13 stage IV sarcoidosis- and 20 healthy controls, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results MMP-1 was significantly higher in IPF than non-IPF UIP (P =.042) and sarcoidosis (P =.027). MMP-7 was significantly higher in IPF than controls (P {\textless}.001), non-IPF UIP (P =.003), secNSIP (P {\textless}.001), and sarcoidosis (P {\textless}.001). The Area Under the Curve for IPF versus other ILD was 0.63 (95{\%}CI, 0.53-0.73) for MMP-1, 0.73 (95{\%}CI, 0.65-0.81) for MMP-7, and 0.74 (95{\%}CI, 0.66-0.82) for MMP-1/MMP-7 combined. Sensitivity and specificity for MMP-7 cutoff = 3.91 ng/mL was 72.3{\%} and 66.3{\%}, respectively, Positive Predictive Values = 52.3{\%} and Negative Predictive Values = 82.4{\%}. Conclusions MMP-1 and particularly MMP-7 serum levels were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF UIP, the main entity in differential diagnosis. The value of these biomarkers as additional tools in a multidisciplinary approach to IPF diagnosis needs to be considered and further explored.},

abstract = {Understanding the functional implications of changes in gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

The median survival of patients with IPF is only 2 to 3 years, yet some patients live much longer. Respiratory failure resulting from disease progression is the most frequent cause of death. To date we have limited information as to predictors of mortality in patients with IPF, and research in this area has failed to yield prediction models that can be reliably used in clinical practice to predict individual risk of mortality. The goal of this concise clinical review is to examine and summarize the current data on the clinical course, individual predictors of survival, and proposed clinical prediction models in IPF.

abstract = {We investigated the pathogenic roles of CC chemokine ligand (CCL)3 and its receptors, CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5, in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF). An intratracheal injection of BLM into wild-type (WT) mice caused a massive infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages, followed by the development of diffuse PF with fibrocyte accumulation. Intrapulmonary CCL3 expression was enhanced rapidly and remained at elevated levels until PF developed. Moreover, CCL3 protein was detected mainly in infiltrating granulocytes and macrophages, whereas transforming growth factor-{\$}\beta{\$}1 protein was detected in macrophages and myofibroblasts. Compared with WT mice, collagen accumulation was reduced in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice. Moreover, the BLM-induced increases in intrapulmonary macrophage and fibrocyte numbers were attenuated in CCL3-/-and CCR5-/-but not CCR1-/-mice, although BLM increased bone marrow (BM) fibrocyte number to a similar extent in these strains. BM transplantation from CCR5-/-to WT, but not that from WT to CCR5-/-mice, recapitulated the phenotypes in CCR5-/-mice. Furthermore, CCR5+/-mice exhibited a significant reduction in BLM-induced fibrotic changes. These results demonstrated that locally produced CCL3 was involved in BLM-induced recruitment of BM-derived macrophages and fibrocytes, main producers of transforming growth factor-{\$}\beta{\$}1, and subsequent development of PF by interacting mainly with CCR5.

abstract = {Macrophages provide a critical systemic network cells of the innate immune system. Emerging data suggest that in addition, they have important tissue-specific functions that range from clearance of surfactant from the lungs to neuronal pruning and establishment of gut homeostasis. The differentiation and tissue-specific activation of macrophages require precise regulation of gene expression, a process governed by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin structure. We argue that epigenetic regulation of macrophages is determined by lineage- and tissue-specific transcription factors controlled by the built-in programming of myeloid development in combination with signaling from the tissue environment. Perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms of tissue macrophage identity can affect normal macrophage tissue function and contribute to pathologies ranging from obesity and autoimmunity to neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE) exerts anti-inflammatory properties that protect against atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. However, mechanisms by which apoE suppresses the cellular activation of leukocytes commonly associated with atherosclerosis remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that apoE suppresses inflammation and atherosclerosis by regulating cellular microRNA levels in these leukocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: An assessment of apoE expression among such leukocyte subsets in wild-type mice revealed that only macrophages and monocytes express apoE abundantly. An absence of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes resulted in enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and an exaggerated inflammatory response on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This correlated with reduced levels of microRNA-146a, a critical negative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Ectopic apoE expression in Apoe(-/-) macrophages and monocytes raised miR-146a levels, whereas its silencing in wild-type cells had an opposite effect. Mechanistically, apoE increased the expression of transcription factor purine-rich PU-box-binding protein 1, which raised levels of pri-miR-146 transcripts, demonstrating that apoE exerts transcriptional control over miR-146a. In vivo, even a small amount of apoE expression in macrophages and monocytes of hypomorphic apoE mice led to increased miR-146a levels, and inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses, Ly-6C(high) monocytosis, and atherosclerosis in the settings of hyperlipidemia. Accordingly, cellular enrichment of miR-146a through the systemic delivery of miR-146a mimetics in Apoe(-/-)Ldlr(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice attenuated monocyte/macrophage activation and atherosclerosis in the absence of plasma lipid reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cellular apoE expression suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis by enhancing miR-146a levels in monocytes and macrophages.},

abstract = {The oleic acid (OA) model of acute lung injury in rats is characterized by a massive and rapid influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) within 1 h, with a peak inflammatory response at 4 h and resolution by 72 h. We hypothesized that PMN apoptosis is involved in the resolution of OA-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, healthy adult Fischer 344 rats were given 30 microl OA in 0.1{\%} bovine serum albumin (BSA) intravenously; controls were given BSA alone and killed at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h after OA to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Cell pellets from BALF and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section samples were processed for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to identify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide was used to counterstain nuclei. Percentage of nuclei undergoing apoptosis was counted under a fluorescent microscope. Control rats showed only resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the BALF with no apoptosis. At the peak of injury, 1 h and 4 h after OA injection, we observed a massive PMN response without any evidence of apoptosis. At 24 h, when the OA injury is clinically and histologically in early resolution, we observed intense apoptosis of PMN nuclei along with evidence of apoptotic bodies in the cytoplasm of AM. Some of the AM also showed apoptotic nuclei at 72 h. Similar observations were made in the lung tissue sections. The results of the TUNEL assay were confirmed by DNA ladders and electron microscopy. We conclude that apoptosis of PMN and clearance by AM is an important mechanism in resolution of OA- induced acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Although acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has become well recognised, the reported incidence and outcomes are highly variable, and risk factors are unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence, risk factors and impact of acute exacerbations, and other known causes of rapid deterioration. This was a retrospective review of 461 patients with IPF (269 cases were biopsy-proven). The median follow-up period was 22.9 months. Rapid deterioration requiring hospitalisation occurred in 163 (35.4{\%}) patients, with multiple episodes in 42 patients. Acute exacerbation was the most frequent cause (55.2{\%}), followed by infection. The 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low forced vital capacity (FVC) were significant risk factors. The in-hospital mortality rate was 50.0{\%}, and the 1- and 5-yr survival rates from the initial diagnosis were 56.2 and 18.4{\%}, respectively. Acute exacerbation was a significant predictor of poor survival after the initial diagnosis, along with increased age, low FVC and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and steroid use with or without cytotoxic therapy. 1- and 3-yr incidences of acute exacerbation were 14.2 and 20.7{\%}, respectively. Never having smoked and low FVC were risk factors. Acute exacerbation had a serious impact on the overall survival of the patients with IPF.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the inhibition of safflor yellow on acute lung injury induced by oleic acid in rats. Method: Acute lung injury model was induced by tail-intravenous injection of oleic acid 0.13 gkg-1 mixed with 0.4{\%} bovine serum albumin, while the drugs or normal saline were injected 30 minutes beforehand. The experiment was made in the Animal Lab and the Pharmacology Lab of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. One hundred and nine healthy Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group (n = 16), model group (re = 18), 30 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 anisodamine group (n = 18) and three safflor yellow (SY) groups: 290 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1(re = 18), 170 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 = 20) and 100 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1(n = 19). The animals were sacrificed after 5 hours of oleic acid injection. The lung morphological changes were observed by optical microscopy and electron microscopy, plasma IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} and IL-6 levels were determined by ELISA, lung index, A index and B index were measured. The data were expressed as (x̄ ± s) and analyzed by One-Way ANOVA after normality and homogeneityof-variance tests by SPSS 10.0 software. A P value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results: Compared with normal group[(41.3± 1.9),(14.2±0.6),(2.99± 0.15),(111 ± 22) {\$}\mu{\$}{\textperiodcentered}L-1, (250±46) {\$}\mu{\$}g-L-1], the lung index, A index, B index as well as the plasma levels of IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} and IL-6[(56.8 ±4.5), (20.0± 1.8), (4.18±0.30), (143±52) {\$}\mu{\$}g{\textperiodcentered}L-1,(302±64) {\$}\mu{\$}g-L-1] remarkably increased in the model group(P {\textless}0.01 or P {\textless}0.05), and the lung morphological changes were obvious, such as: alveolar septum widened, edema existing in interstitial spaces, etc. In the three SY groups and the anisodamine group, the lung morphological changes were ameliorated; the three indexes and the levels of IL-1{\$}\beta{\$} and IL-6 were significantly reduced (P {\textless}0.01 or P {\textless}0.05), compared with the model group. Conclusions: SY significantly inhibited oleic acid induced lung inflammation in rats.},

abstract = {Improved methods for integrated analysis of heterogeneous large-scale omic data are direly needed. Here, we take a network-based approach to this challenge. Given two networks, representing different types of gene interactions, we construct a map of linked modules, where modules are genes strongly connected in the first network and links represent strong inter-module connections in the second. We develop novel algorithms that considerably outperform prior art on simulated and real data from three distinct domains. First, by analyzing protein-protein interactions and negative genetic interactions in yeast, we discover epistatic relations among protein complexes. Second, we analyze protein-protein interactions and DNA damage-specific positive genetic interactions in yeast and reveal functional rewiring among protein complexes, suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response. Finally, using transcriptomes of non-small-cell lung cancer patients, we analyze networks of global co-expression and disease-dependent differential co-expression and identify a sharp drop in correlation between two modules of immune activation processes, with possible microRNA control. Our study demonstrates that module maps are a powerful tool for deeper analysis of heterogeneous high-throughput omic data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Much research effort has been devoted to the identification of enriched gene sets for microarray experiments. However, identified gene sets are often found to be inconsistent among independent studies. This is probably owing to the noisy data of microarray experiments coupled with small sample sizes of individual studies. Therefore, combining information from multiple studies is likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes. As more and more data become available, it calls for statistical methods to integrate information from multiple studies, also known as meta-analysis, to improve the power of identifying enriched gene sets. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian model that provides a coherent framework for joint modeling of both gene set information and gene expression data from multiple studies, to improve the detection of enriched gene sets by leveraging information from different sources available. One distinct feature of our method is that it directly models the gene expression data, instead of using summary statistics, when synthesizing studies. Besides, the proposed model is flexible and offers an appropriate treatment of between-study heterogeneities that frequently arise in the meta-analysis of microarray experiments. We show that under our Bayesian model, the full posterior conditionals all have known distributions, which greatly facilitates the MCMC computation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the power of gene set enrichment meta-analysis, as opposed to existing methods developed by Shen and Tseng (2010, Bioinformatics, 26, 1316-1323), and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations from the distributional assumption for gene expression data. We illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining eight lung cancer datasets for gene set enrichment analysis, which demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can emerge from certain pathologies, such as sepsis, fat embolism and leptospirosis, in which the levels of unesterified fatty acids are increased in the patient's plasma. ARDS is characterized by edema formation, and edema resolution occurs mainly due to the pneumocyte Na/K-ATPase activity. As previously described, increased oleic acid (OA) plasma concentrations induce lung injury by interfering with sodium transport. The first aim of this study was to develop a radioactivity-free assay to detect Na,K-ATPase activity ex vivo using a model of OA-induced lung injury in mice. We also investigated the relationship between Na/K-ATPase inhibition and OA-induced lung injury using ouabain-induced lung injury as a comparison, because of the well-described effect of ouabain as a Na/K-ATPase inhibitor.METHODS:We developed a Na/K-ATPase assay based on the capture of non-radioactive Rb+ ions by mice lung tissue in the absence or presence of ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase inhibitor. Rb+ incorporation into the lung was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after lung tissue mineralization. Na/K-ATPase activity was considered as the difference between Rb+ incorporation in the absence and in the presence of ouabain. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected for lung injury assessment. For this assessment, cell counting, lipid body enumeration and lipid mediator concentrations were measured. Histological analyses were used to determinate lung pathology. Whole body plethysmographic analysis was performed to assay lung function.RESULTS:The lung Na/K-ATPase activity of mice was completely inhibited by an OA dose of 10mumol, an effect also obtained with 10-3mumol of ouabain, as demonstrated by the decreased Rb+ incorporation in the lungs. The same OA dose induced lung edema and inflammation with cell influx, lipid body formation, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Ouabain also induced lung inflammation, as detected by histological examinations. As far as we know, this is the first time that ouabain-induced lung injury was shown. Both OA and ouabain induced functional lung pathology in mice simultaneously with inhibition of the lung Na/K-ATPase activity.CONCLUSIONS:We developed a new non-radioactive assay to quantified Na/K-ATPase in vivo. OA and ouabain inhibited in vivo Na/K-ATPase activity in the lungs and induced lung injury. Our data reinforce the idea that Na/K-ATPase inhibitors may worsen lung injury in specific pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of lethal, chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Over the past decade, macrophage has been recognized to play a significant role in IPF pathogenesis. Depending on the local microenvironments, macrophages can be polarized to either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. In general, M1 macrophages are responsible for wound healing after alveolar epithelial injury, while M2 macrophages are designated to resolve wound healing processes or terminate inflammatory responses in the lung. IPF is a pathological consequence resulted from altered wound healing in response to persistent lung injury. In this review, we intend to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the process of macrophage polarization and its mediators in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our goal is to update the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of IPF, and by which, we expect to provide help for developing effective therapeutic strategies in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF5 that lead to higher mRNA expression are associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IRF5 expression in macrophages was reversibly induced by inflammatory stimuli and contributed to the plasticity of macrophage polarization. High expression of IRF5 was characteristic of M1 macrophages, in which it directly activated transcription of the genes encoding interleukin 12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40), IL-12p35 and IL-23p19 and repressed the gene encoding IL-10. Consequently, those macrophages set up the environment for a potent T helper type 1 (T(H)1)-T(H)17 response. Global gene expression analysis demonstrated that exogenous IRF5 upregulated or downregulated expression of established phenotypic markers of M1 or M2 macrophages, respectively. Our data suggest a critical role for IRF5 in M1 macrophage polarization and define a previously unknown function for IRF5 as a transcriptional repressor.},

abstract = {IL-1 is an important mediator of inflammation and tissue damage in multiple organs, both in experimental animal models of disease and in human diseases. The IL-1 family consists of two agonists, IL-1$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$, two receptors, biologically active IL-1RI and inert IL-1RII, and a specific receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. The balance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra in local tissues plays an important role in the susceptibility to and severity of many diseases. An allelic polymorphism in the IL-1Ra gene has been associated with a variety of human diseases primarily of epithelial and endothelial cell origin. This association may be secondary to an imbalance in the IL-1 system with enhanced production of IL-1$\beta$ and reduced production of the major intracellular isoform of IL-1Ra. Treatment of RA with daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant IL-1Ra protein has been shown to be efficacious. Gene therapy approaches with IL-1Ra are being evaluated for the treatment of RA and other human diseases. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Lung macrophages have been reported to regulate both progression and remission of bleomycin-induced diffuse PF. However, it remains unclear how macrophages contribute to silica-induced progressive nodular PF and the associated tissue cell responses in vivo. We found that lack of monocyte-derived macrophages results in the formation of diffuse PF after silica instillation. We found that the proportion and the number of monocyte-derived macrophages were persistently higher in silica-induced progressive PF compared with bleomycin-induced PF. Surprisingly, in Ccr2-/-mice, in which monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration is impaired, silica administration induced diffuse PF with loose nodule formation and greater activation of tissue cells. In the diffuse lesions, the distribution of epithelial cells, distribution of myofibroblasts, and architecture of the basement membrane were disrupted. Consistent with the development of diffuse lesions, genes that were differentially expressed in CD45-tissue cells from the lung of wild-type and Ccr2-/-mice were highly enriched in human diffuse, progressive PF. In gene ontology network analyses, many of these genes were associated with tissue remodeling and included genes not previously associated with PF, such as Mmp14, Thbs2, and Fgfr4. Overall, these results indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages prevent transition from nodular to diffuse silica-induced PF, potentially by regulating tissue cell responses.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is a common cause of invasive and allergic pulmonary disease. Resting conidia of the filamentous fungus are constantly inhaled, but cause infection only after initiating hyphal growth. In this study, we have explored whether macrophages can distinguish between resting spores and the maturing, potentially invasive form of the fungus. Although macrophages bind and ingest A. fumigatus resting conidia efficiently, there is little inflammatory response; NF-kappabeta is not activated, inflammatory cytokines are not induced, and reactive oxygen species are not produced. However, maturing A. fumigatus conidia and germ tubes stimulate NF-kappabeta, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and production of reactive oxygen by human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophages from multiple anatomical sites. These responses are in part mediated by dectin-1, which binds cell wall beta-glucan that is not present on the surface of dormant conidia, but is present after cellular swelling and loss of the hydrophobic proteinaceous cell wall. Dectin-1 binding to germ tubes augments, but is not required for, TLR2-mediated inflammatory cytokine secretion. Dectin-1 recognition of germ tubes also stimulates TNF-alpha production in the absence of both TLR2 and MyD88 signaling. These data demonstrate one mechanism by which the pulmonary inflammatory response is tailored toward metabolically active cells, thereby avoiding unnecessary tissue damage with frequent inhalation of ubiquitous spores.},

abstract = {Gene set analysis methods, which consider predefined groups of genes in the analysis of genomic data, have been successfully applied for analyzing gene expression data in cross-sectional studies. The time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA) introduced here is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates. It allows to use all available repeated measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When biological conditions are compared, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. The interest of the method is illustrated by its application to two real life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial), and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis corrected for multiple testing as well as a standard a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series both failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. When applied to the second illustrative data set, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets finally found to be linked with the influenza vaccine too although they were found to be associated to the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses. In our simulation study TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is made available for the community through an R package.},

abstract = {The systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic disorders collectively represent one of the most serious health problems world-wide causing a large proportion of the total world population mortality. The molecular pathways involved in their pathogenesis are complex and despite intensive investigations have not been fully elucidated. Whereas chronic inflammatory cell infiltration is universally present in fibrotic lesions, the central role of monocytes and macrophages as regulators of inflammation and fibrosis has only recently become apparent. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the contribution of monocytes/macrophages to the initiation, establishment, or progression of the fibrotic process remain largely unknown. Several monocyte and macrophage subpopulations have been identified, with certain phenotypes promoting inflammation whereas others display profibrotic effects. Given the unmet need for effective treatments for fibroproliferative diseases and the crucial regulatory role of monocyte/macrophage subpopulations in fibrogenesis, the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific monocyte/macrophage subpopulations has become increasingly attractive. We will provide here an overview of the current understanding of the role of monocyte/macrophage phenotype subpopulations in animal models of tissue fibrosis and in various systemic and organ-specific human fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, we will discuss recent approaches to the design of effective anti-fibrotic therapeutic interventions by targeting the phenotypic differences identified between the various monocyte and macrophage subpopulations.},
